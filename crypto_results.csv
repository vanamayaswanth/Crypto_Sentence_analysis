"no, we do not list all cryptocurrencies at coinmarketcap. as a company and team, we are very aware that not all coins and projects have good intentions. while we cannot guarantee to exclude them all, we have a vetting process that each coin goes through before it is listed on the site. if we suspect that a coin or project is a scam, it does not get listed.",1
"at the time of writing, we estimate that there are around 8,000 coins, tokens and projects in the global coin market. as mentioned above, we have a due diligence process that we apply to new coins before they are listed. this process controls how many of the cryptocurrencies from the global market are represented on our site.",1
"the very first cryptocurrency was  bitcoin. since it is open source, it is possible for other people to use the majority of the code, make a few changes and then launch their own separate currency. many people have done exactly this. some of these coins are very similar to bitcoin, with just one or two amended features (such as litecoin), while others are very different, with varying models of security, issuance and governance. however, they all share the same moniker — every coin issued after bitcoin is considered to be an altcoin.",1
"ico stands for initial coin offering. many of the smaller projects in the crypto space — and a few of the largest ones — raised money from private investors around the world in the crypto equivalent of a crowdfunding campaign. investors would send funds — usually in the form of bitcoin — to the project and receive coin or tokens in return. most icos happened in 2017 and early 2018 and used ethereum as a platform of operation via the erc-20 standard. in 2018, the united states securities and exchange commission (sec) clarified their rules relating to fundraising for assets, which made it much harder for new cryptocurrency projects to issue their own tokens in this way. since the appearance of the sec guidance and the organization’s heightened interest in regulating icos for u.s. citizens, the number of icos has been reduced substantially.",1
"price volatility has long been one of the features of the cryptocurrency market. when asset prices move quickly in either direction and the market itself is relatively thin, it can sometimes be difficult to conduct transactions as might be needed. to overcome this problem, a new type of cryptocurrency tied in value to existing currencies — ranging from the u.s. dollar, other fiats or even other cryptocurrencies — arose. these new cryptocurrency are known as stablecoins, and they can be used for a multitude of purposes due to their stability.",1

"individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger, which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.[4][5][6] despite their name, cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional sense and while varying treatments have been applied to them, including classification as commodities, securities, as well as currencies, cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice.[7][8][9] some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency. in a proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as collateral. in return, they get authority over the token in proportion to the amount they stake. generally, these token stakers get additional ownership in the token over time via network fees, newly minted tokens or other such reward mechanisms.[10]",1
"cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority. cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency (cbdc).[11] when a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. when implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.[12] traditional asset classes like currencies, commodities, and stocks, as well as macroeconomic factors, have modest exposures to cryptocurrency returns.[13]",1
"the first decentralized cryptocurrency was bitcoin, which first released as open-source software in 2009. as of march 2022  there were more than 9,000 other cryptocurrencies in the marketplace, of which more than 70 had a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion.[14]",1
"in 1983, american cryptographer david chaum conceived of a type of cryptographic electronic money called ecash.[15][16] later, in 1995, he implemented it through digicash,[17] an early form of cryptographic electronic payments. digicash required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before it can be sent to a recipient. this allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by a third party.",1
"in 1996, the national security agency published a paper entitled how to make a mint: the cryptography of anonymous electronic cash, describing a cryptocurrency system. the paper was first published in an mit mailing list[18] and later in 1997 in the american law review.[19]",1
"in the 1997 book the sovereign individual, the authors, william rees-mogg and james dale davidson, predict that the currency used in the information age would be using ""mathematical algorithms that have no physical existence"",[20] which has led some in the cryptocurrency community to call the book's claim a ""prophecy"".[21]",0
"in 1998, wei dai described ""b-money"", an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system.[22] shortly thereafter, nick szabo described bit gold.[23] like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that would follow it, bit gold (not to be confused with the later gold-based exchange bitgold) was described as an electronic currency system which required users to complete a proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published.",1
"in january 2009, bitcoin was created by pseudonymous developer satoshi nakamoto. it used sha-256, a cryptographic hash function, in its proof-of-work scheme.[24][25] in april 2011, namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized dns. in october 2011, litecoin was released which used scrypt as its hash function instead of sha-256. peercoin, created in august 2012, used a hybrid of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.[26]",1
"on 6 august 2014, the uk announced its treasury had commissioned a study of cryptocurrencies, and what role, if any, they could play in the uk economy. the study was also to report on whether regulation should be considered.[27] its final report was published in 2018,[28] and it issued a consultation on cryptoassets and stablecoins in january 2021.[29]",1
"tokens, cryptocurrencies, and other digital assets other than bitcoin are collectively known as alternative cryptocurrencies,[35][36][37] typically shortened to ""altcoins"" or ""alt coins"",[38][39] or disparagingly ""shitcoins"".[40] paul vigna of the wall street journal also described altcoins as ""alternative versions of bitcoin""[41] given its role as the model protocol for altcoin designers.",1
"stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable level of purchasing power.[48] notably, these designs are not foolproof, as a number of stablecoins have crashed or lost their peg. for example, on 11 may 2022, terra's stablecoin ust fell from $1 to 26 cents.[49][50] the subsequent failure of terraform labs resulted in the loss of nearly $40b invested in the terra and luna bitcoins.[51] in september 2022, south korean prosecutors requested the issuance of an interpol red notice against the company's founder, do kwon.[52]",1
"within a proof-of-work system such as bitcoin, the safety, integrity and balance of ledgers is maintained by a community of mutually distrustful parties referred to as miners. miners use their computers to help validate and timestamp transactions, adding them to the ledger in accordance with a particular timestamping scheme.[24] in a proof-of-stake blockchain, transactions are validated by holders of the associated cryptocurrency, sometimes grouped together in stake pools.",1
"most cryptocurrencies are designed to gradually decrease the production of that currency, placing a cap on the total amount of that currency that will ever be in circulation.[54] compared with ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as cash on hand, cryptocurrencies can be more difficult for seizure by law enforcement.[4]",1
"the validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by a blockchain. a blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.[53][55] each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block,[55] a timestamp and transaction data.[56] by design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. it is ""an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way"".[57] for use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.",1
blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high byzantine fault tolerance. decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain.[58],0
"a node is a computer that connects to a cryptocurrency network. the node supports the cryptocurrency's network through either; relaying transactions, validation or hosting a copy of the blockchain. in terms of relaying transactions each network computer (node) has a copy of the blockchain of the cryptocurrency it supports. when a transaction is made the node creating the transaction broadcasts details of the transaction using encryption to other nodes throughout the node network so that the transaction (and every other transaction) is known.",1
"node owners are either volunteers, those hosted by the organization or body responsible for developing the cryptocurrency blockchain network technology, or those who are enticed to host a node to receive rewards from hosting the node network.[59]",1
"cryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to ""prove"" the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party.",1
"another method is called the proof-of-stake scheme. proof-of-stake is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency. it is different from proof-of-work systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions. the scheme is largely dependent on the coin, and there's currently no standard form of it. some cryptocurrencies use a combined proof-of-work and proof-of-stake scheme.[26]",1
"on a blockchain, mining is the validation of transactions. for this effort, successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward. the reward decreases transaction fees by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network. the rate of generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized machines such as fpgas and asics running complex hashing algorithms like sha-256 and scrypt.[60] this arms race for cheaper-yet-efficient machines has existed since bitcoin was introduced in 2009.[60]",1
"with more people venturing into the world of virtual currency, generating hashes for validation has become more complex over time, forcing miners to invest increasingly large sums of money to improve computing performance. consequently, the reward for finding a hash has diminished and often does not justify the investment in equipment and cooling facilities (to mitigate the heat the equipment produces), and the electricity required to run them.[61] popular regions for mining include those with inexpensive electricity, a cold climate, and jurisdictions with clear and conducive regulations. by july 2019, bitcoin's electricity consumption was estimated to be approximately 7 gigawatts, around 0.2% of the global total, or equivalent to the energy consumed nationally by switzerland.[62]",1
"some miners pool resources, sharing their processing power over a network to split the reward equally, according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a block. a ""share"" is awarded to members of the mining pool who present a valid partial proof-of-work.",1
"as of february 2018[update], the chinese government has halted trading of virtual currency, banned initial coin offerings and shut down mining. many chinese miners have since relocated to canada[63] and texas.[64] one company is operating data centers for mining operations at canadian oil and gas field sites, due to low gas prices.[65] in june 2018, hydro quebec proposed to the provincial government to allocate 500 megawatts of power to crypto companies for mining.[66] according to a february 2018 report from fortune, iceland has become a haven for cryptocurrency miners in part because of its cheap electricity.[67]",1
"in march 2018, the city of plattsburgh, new york put an 18-month moratorium on all cryptocurrency mining in an effort to preserve natural resources and the ""character and direction"" of the city.[68] in 2021, kazakhstan became the second-biggest crypto-currency mining country, producing 18.1% of the global hash rate. the country built a compound containing 50,000 computers near ekibastuz.[69]",1
"an increase in cryptocurrency mining increased the demand for graphics cards (gpu) in 2017.[70] the computing power of gpus makes them well-suited to generating hashes. popular favorites of cryptocurrency miners such as nvidia's gtx 1060 and gtx 1070 graphics cards, as well as amd's rx 570 and rx 580 gpus, doubled or tripled in price – or were out of stock.[71] a gtx 1070 ti which was released at a price of $450 sold for as much as $1,100. another popular card, the gtx 1060 (6 gb model) was released at an msrp of $250, and sold for almost $500. rx 570 and rx 580 cards from amd were out of stock for almost a year. miners regularly buy up the entire stock of new gpu's as soon as they are available.[72]",1
"nvidia has asked retailers to do what they can when it comes to selling gpus to gamers instead of miners. boris böhles, pr manager for nvidia in the german region, said: ""gamers come first for nvidia.""[73]",0
"a cryptocurrency wallet is a means of storing the public and private ""keys"" (address) or seed which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency.[74] with the private key, it is possible to write in the public ledger, effectively spending the associated cryptocurrency. with the public key, it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet.",1
"there exist multiple methods of storing keys or seed in a wallet. these methods range from using paper wallets (which are public, private or seed keys written on paper), to using hardware wallets (which are hardware to store your wallet information), to a digital wallet (which is a computer with a software hosting your wallet information), to hosting your wallet using an exchange where cryptocurrency is traded, or by storing your wallet information on a digital medium such as plaintext.[75]",1
"bitcoin is pseudonymous, rather than anonymous; the cryptocurrency in a wallet is not tied to a person, but rather to one or more specific keys (or ""addresses"").[76] thereby, bitcoin owners are not immediately identifiable, but all transactions are publicly available in the blockchain.[77] still, cryptocurrency exchanges are often required by law to collect the personal information of their users.[78]",1
"proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, offer block rewards incentives for miners. there has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the blockchain, but a study suggests that this may not be the case under certain circumstances.[81]",1
"the current value, not the long-term value, of the cryptocurrency supports the reward scheme to incentivize miners to engage in costly mining activities.[83] some sources claim that the current bitcoin design is very inefficient, generating a welfare loss of 1.4% relative to an efficient cash system. the main source for this inefficiency is the large mining cost, which is estimated to be us$360 million per year. this translates into users being willing to accept a cash system with an inflation rate of 230% before being better off using bitcoin as a means of payment. however, the efficiency of the bitcoin system can be significantly improved by optimizing the rate of coin creation and minimizing transaction fees. another potential improvement is to eliminate inefficient mining activities by changing the consensus protocol altogether.[84]",1
"some cryptocurrencies have no transaction fees, and instead rely on client-side proof-of-work as the transaction prioritization and anti-spam mechanism.[87][88][89]",1
"cryptocurrency exchanges allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies[90] for other assets, such as conventional fiat money, or to trade between different digital currencies.",1
"crypto marketplaces do not guarantee that an investor is completing a purchase or trade at the optimal price. as a result, many investors take advantage of this by using arbitrage to find the difference in price across several markets.[91]",1
"atomic swaps are a mechanism where one cryptocurrency can be exchanged directly for another cryptocurrency, without the need for a trusted third party such as an exchange.[92]",1
"jordan kelley, founder of robocoin, launched the first bitcoin atm in the united states on 20 february 2014. the kiosk installed in austin, texas, is similar to bank atms but has scanners to read government-issued identification such as a driver's license or a passport to confirm users' identities.[93]",1
"an initial coin offering (ico) is a controversial means of raising funds for a new cryptocurrency venture. an ico may be used by startups with the intention of avoiding regulation. however, securities regulators in many jurisdictions, including in the u.s., and canada, have indicated that if a coin or token is an ""investment contract"" (e.g., under the howey test, i.e., an investment of money with a reasonable expectation of profit based significantly on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others), it is a security and is subject to securities regulation. in an ico campaign, a percentage of the cryptocurrency (usually in the form of ""tokens"") is sold to early backers of the project in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies, often bitcoin or ether.[94][95][96]",1
"according to pricewaterhousecoopers, four of the 10 biggest proposed initial coin offerings have used switzerland as a base, where they are frequently registered as non-profit foundations. the swiss regulatory agency finma stated that it would take a ""balanced approach"" to ico projects and would allow ""legitimate innovators to navigate the regulatory landscape and so launch their projects in a way consistent with national laws protecting investors and the integrity of the financial system."" in response to numerous requests by industry representatives, a legislative ico working group began to issue legal guidelines in 2018, which are intended to remove uncertainty from cryptocurrency offerings and to establish sustainable business practices.[97]",1
"the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency is calculated by multiplying the price by the number of coins in circulation. the total cryptocurrency market cap has historically been dominated by bitcoin accounting for at least 50% of the market cap value where altcoins have increased and decreased in market cap value in relation to bitcoin. bitcoin's value is largely determined by speculation among other technological limiting factors known as blockchain rewards coded into the architecture technology of bitcoin itself. the cryptocurrency market cap follows a trend known as the ""halving"", which is when the block rewards received from bitcoin are halved due to technological mandated limited factors instilled into bitcoin which in turn limits the supply of bitcoin. as the date reaches near of a halving (twice thus far historically) the cryptocurrency market cap increases, followed by a downtrend.[98]",1
"cryptocurrency prices are much more volatile than established financial assets such as stocks. for example, over one week in may 2022, bitcoin lost 20% of its value and ethereum lost 26%, while solana and cardano lost 41% and 35% respectively. the falls were attributed to warnings about inflation. by comparison, in the same week, the nasdaq tech stock index fell 7.6 per cent and the ftse 100 was 3.6 per cent down.[102]",1
"in the longer term, of the 10 leading cryptocurrencies identified by the total value of coins in circulation in january 2018, only four (bitcoin, ethereum, cardano and ripple (xrp)) were still in that position in early 2022.[103]",1
"there are also centralized databases, outside of blockchains, that store crypto market data. compared to the blockchain, databases perform fast as there is no verification process. four of the most popular cryptocurrency market databases are coinmarketcap, coingecko, bravenewcoin, and cryptocompare.[104]",1
"according to alan feuer of the new york times, libertarians and anarcho-capitalists were attracted to the philosophical idea behind bitcoin. early bitcoin supporter roger ver said: ""at first, almost everyone who got involved did so for philosophical reasons. we saw bitcoin as a great idea, as a way to separate money from the state.""[105] economist paul krugman argues that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are ""something of a cult"" based in ""paranoid fantasies"" of government power.[106]",1
"nigel dodd argues in the social life of bitcoin that the essence of the bitcoin ideology is to remove money from both social and governmental control.[107] dodd discusses the ""declaration of bitcoin's independence"", a message of crypto-anarchism with the words: ""bitcoin is inherently anti-establishment, anti-system, and anti-state. bitcoin undermines governments and disrupts institutions because bitcoin is fundamentally humanitarian.""[108][109]",1
"david golumbia says that the ideas influencing bitcoin advocates emerge from right-wing extremist movements such as the liberty lobby and the john birch society and their anti-central bank rhetoric, or, more recently, ron paul and tea party-style libertarianism.[110] steve bannon, who owns a ""good stake"" in bitcoin, sees cryptocurrency as a form of disruptive populism, taking control back from central authorities.[111]",1
"bitcoin's founder, satoshi nakamoto has supported the idea that cryptocurrencies go well with libertarianism: ""it's very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly."" nakamoto said in 2008.[112]",1
"according to the european central bank, the decentralization of money offered by bitcoin has its theoretical roots in the austrian school of economics, especially with friedrich von hayek in his book denationalisation of money: the argument refined,[113] in which hayek advocates a complete free market in the production, distribution and management of money to end the monopoly of central banks.[114]",1
"the rise in the popularity of cryptocurrencies and their adoption by financial institutions has led some governments to assess whether regulation is needed to protect users. the financial action task force (fatf) has defined cryptocurrency-related services as ""virtual asset service providers"" (vasps) and recommended that they be regulated with the same money laundering (aml) and know your customer (kyc) requirements as financial institutions.[115]",1
"in may 2020, the joint working group on intervasp messaging standards published ""ivms 101"", a universal common language for communication of required originator and beneficiary information between vasps. the fatf and financial regulators were informed as the data model was developed.[116]",0
"in june 2020, fatf updated its guidance to include the ""travel rule"" for cryptocurrencies, a measure which mandates that vasps obtain, hold, and exchange information about the originators and beneficiaries of virtual asset transfers.[117] subsequent standardized protocol specifications recommended using json for relaying data between vasps and identity services. as of december 2020, the ivms 101 data model has yet to be finalized and ratified by the three global standard setting bodies that created it.[118]",1
"on 10 june 2021, the basel committee on banking supervision proposed that banks that held cryptocurrency assets must set aside capital to cover all potential losses. for instance, if a bank were to hold bitcoin worth $2 billion, it would be required to set aside enough capital to cover the entire $2 billion. this is a more extreme standard than banks are usually held to when it comes to other assets. however, this is a proposal and not a regulation.",1
"the imf is seeking a co-ordinated, consistent and comprehensive approach to supervising cryptocurrencies. tobias adrian, the imf's financial counsellor and head of its monetary and capital markets department said in a january 2022 interview that ""agreeing global regulations is never quick. but if we start now, we can achieve the goal of maintaining financial stability while also enjoying the benefits which the underlying technological innovations bring,""[121]",1
"in september 2017, china banned icos to cause abnormal return from cryptocurrency decreasing during announcement window. the liquidity changes by banning icos in china was temporarily negative while the liquidity effect became positive after news.[125]",1
"on 18 may 2021, china banned financial institutions and payment companies from being able to provide cryptocurrency transaction related services.[126] this led to a sharp fall in the price of the biggest proof of work cryptocurrencies. for instance, bitcoin fell 31%, ethereum fell 44%, binance coin fell 32% and dogecoin fell 30%.[127] proof of work mining was the next focus, with regulators in popular mining regions citing the use of electricity generated from highly polluting sources such as coal to create bitcoin and ethereum.[128]",1
"in september 2021, the chinese government declared all cryptocurrency transactions of any kind illegal, completing its crackdown on cryptocurrency.[32]",1
"in the united kingdom, as of 10 january 2021, all cryptocurrency firms, such as exchanges, advisors and professionals that have either a presence, market product or provide services within the uk market must register with the financial conduct authority. additionally, on 27 june 2021, the financial watchdog demanded that binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange,[129] cease all regulated activities in the uk.[130]",1
"south africa, who has seen a large amount of scams related to cryptocurrency is said to be putting a regulatory timeline in place, that will produce a regulatory framework.[131] the largest scam occurred in april 2021, where the two founders of an african-based cryptocurrency exchange called africrypt, raees cajee and ameer cajee, disappeared with $3.8 billion worth of bitcoin.[132] additionally, mirror trading international disappeared with $170 million worth of cryptocurrency in january 2021.[132]",1
"in march 2021, south korea implemented new legislation to strengthen their oversight of digital assets. this legislation requires all digital asset managers, providers and exchanges to be registered with the korea financial intelligence unit in order to operate in south korea.[133] registering with this unit requires that all exchanges are certified by the information security management system and that they ensure all customers have real name bank accounts. it also requires that the ceo and board members of the exchanges have not been convicted of any crimes and that the exchange holds sufficient levels of deposit insurance to cover losses arising from hacks.[133]",1
"on 30 april 2021, the central bank of the republic of turkey banned the use of cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets for making purchases on the grounds that the use of cryptocurrencies for such payments poses significant transaction risks.[134]",1
"at present, india neither prohibits nor allows investment in the cryptocurrency market. in 2020, the supreme court of india had lifted the ban on cryptocurrency, which was imposed by the reserve bank of india.[136][137][138][139] since then the investment in cryptocurrency is considered legitimate though there is still ambiguity about the issues regarding the extent and payment of tax on the income accrued thereupon and also its regulatory regime. but it is being contemplated that the indian parliament will soon pass a specific law to either ban or regulate the cryptocurrency market in india.[140] expressing his public policy opinion on the indian cryptocurrency market to a well-known online publication, a leading public policy lawyer and vice president of saarclaw (south asian association for regional co-operation in law) hemant batra has said that the ""cryptocurrency market has now become very big with involvement of billions of dollars in the market hence, it is now unattainable and irreconcilable for the government to completely ban all sorts of cryptocurrency and its trading and investment"".[141] he mooted regulating the cryptocurrency market rather than completely banning it. he favoured following imf and fatf guidelines in this regard.",1
"the legal status of cryptocurrencies varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them. at least one study has shown that broad generalizations about the use of bitcoin in illicit finance are significantly overstated and that blockchain analysis is an effective crime fighting and intelligence gathering tool.[142] while some countries have explicitly allowed their use and trade,[143] others have banned or restricted it. according to the library of congress in 2018, an ""absolute ban"" on trading or using cryptocurrencies applies in eight countries: algeria, bolivia, egypt, iraq, morocco, nepal, pakistan, and the united arab emirates. an ""implicit ban"" applies in another 15 countries, which include bahrain, bangladesh, china, colombia, the dominican republic, indonesia, iran, kuwait, lesotho, lithuania, macau, oman, qatar, saudi arabia and taiwan.[144] in the united states and canada, state and provincial securities regulators, coordinated through the north american securities administrators association, are investigating ""bitcoin scams"" and icos in 40 jurisdictions.[145]",1
"various government agencies, departments, and courts have classified bitcoin differently. china central bank banned the handling of bitcoins by financial institutions in china in early 2014.",1
"in russia, though owning cryptocurrency is legal, its residents are only allowed to purchase goods from other residents using russian ruble while nonresidents are allowed to use foreign currency.[146] regulations and bans that apply to bitcoin probably extend to similar cryptocurrency systems.[147]",1
"on 25 march 2014, the united states internal revenue service (irs) ruled that bitcoin will be treated as property for tax purposes. therefore, virtual currencies are considered commodities subject to capital gains tax.[153]",1
"as the popularity and demand for online currencies has increased since the inception of bitcoin in 2009,[154] so have concerns that such an unregulated person to person global economy that cryptocurrencies offer may become a threat to society. concerns abound that altcoins may become tools for anonymous web criminals.[155]",1
"cryptocurrency networks display a lack of regulation that has been criticized as enabling criminals who seek to evade taxes and launder money. money laundering issues are also present in regular bank transfers, however with bank-to-bank wire transfers for instance, the account holder must at least provide a proven identity.",1
"transactions that occur through the use and exchange of these altcoins are independent from formal banking systems, and therefore can make tax evasion simpler for individuals. since charting taxable income is based upon what a recipient reports to the revenue service, it becomes extremely difficult to account for transactions made using existing cryptocurrencies, a mode of exchange that is complex and difficult to track.[155]",1

"bitcoin first appeared in 2009, and it's already challenging everything we've come to accept about money, financial institutions, and even government. the digital currency can be nearly anonymous. and it can be traded internationally—without the fees, government regulation, and bank oversight of paper money. but bitcoin is still risky. its value fluctuates wildly. more than $400 billion of it disappeared overnight with the fall of a single trading exchange. how is that possible? and why is it so popular? cnnmoney reporter jose pagliery explains it all. he details the digital currency's mysterious origins. he explores the dark side of bitcoin: a world of drugs and assassins for hire. and he examines the economic impact of this revolutionary concept through interviews with pensive economists, wary bank regulators, and free market proponents such as ron paul. bitcoin: and the future of money explains how it works and why it matters. the book is essential reading for anyone looking to understand a financial innovation that will forever change how we think about money.",1

"the digital revolution is a change from analog and electronic technology to digital technology and is currently at its peak. since we live in the digital era, it is logical that the digital form of money, that is, the cryptocurrency, had to appear. the cryptocurrency as a digital form of money functions with the help of a technique called cryptography. cryptography is a process that translates legible information into codes that cannot be broken at all. the cryptocurrency is based on the digitized so-called. the main book of all crypto watch transactions called blockchain. blockchain records individual transactions and ownership of all cryptocurrencies that are in circulation, and this system is managed by the so-called blockchain 'miners' who have to update all transactions that have occurred and ensure the accuracy of the information. in this way, the security of the transaction is confirmed. this paper will address the theme of the cryptocurrency and their role in economic growth. types of cryptocurrencies will also be shown as well as their expansion in countries in transition. among other things, we will see the market of the currency in serbia and switzerland.",1

"after years of delays, discussions and frantic experimentation, the popular cryptocurrency platform ethereum completed a long-awaited software upgrade known as the merge, shifting to a more environmentally sustainable framework.",1
"ethereum is arguably the most crucial platform in the crypto industry, a layer of software infrastructure that forms the basis of thousands of applications handling more than $50 billion in customer funds. the upgrade is expected to reduce ethereum’s energy consumption and set the stage for future improvements that will make the platform easier and cheaper to use.",1
"celebrations erupted on a youtube livestream where engineers and researchers who worked on the merge had gathered to mark the milestone. it was a rare moment of joy in a grim year for crypto that saw a devastating market crash drain nearly $1 trillion from the industry, forcing some prominent crypto companies into bankruptcy.",0
"“this is going as well as it could so far,” said danny ryan, an ethereum researcher who has worked on the merge, as he celebrated with a group of colleagues.",1
"crypto users were on the lookout for any glitches that could complicate the transition. a flaw in the merge could imperil the broader crypto industry, upending start-ups and sending the market into a tailspin. the cryptocurrency exchange coinbase announced in august that it would pause certain ethereum deposits and withdrawals during the merge as a precautionary measure.",1
"“i don’t want to claim everything will go perfectly without a hitch,” said tim beiko, who works for the ethereum foundation, a nonprofit that helps maintain the platform. “we’re kind of confident we won’t see network-level issues just because we’ve run through the thing so many times before.”",1
"the technical details of the merge are mind-bendingly complex. but, ultimately, the process boils down to a shift in how cryptocurrency transactions are verified.",1
"in traditional finance, an exchange of funds involves an intermediary, like a bank, which verifies that one entity has enough money to make a payment to another.",1
"crypto was designed to eliminate such financial gatekeepers. so, early crypto engineers had to devise an alternative system to ensure that users had the funds they claimed to have. their solution was called “proof of work.” under that system, powerful computers run software that races to solve complex problems, verifying transactions in the process. the system is widely known as “mining” because the computers earn payments in cryptocurrency as rewards for the verification service.",1
"bitcoin, the original and most valuable cryptocurrency, runs on a proof-of-work system. and, until the merge, so did ethereum. but the process is environmentally draining: to run all those computers requires an enormous amount of energy.",1
"the merge shifts ethereum to a verification system called “proof of stake” that uses less energy. unlike proof of work, the new framework does not involve an energy-guzzling computational race. instead, participants deposit (or “stake”) a certain amount of their crypto savings in a pool, which enters them in a lottery. every time a crypto transaction requires approval, a winner is selected to verify the exchange and receive a reward.",1
"by some estimates, ethereum’s shift to proof of stake will reduce its energy consumption by more than 99 percent. and the project’s developers say the switch will make it easier to design future updates that minimize so-called gas fees — the costs of executing a transaction in ether, the cryptocurrency associated with the ethereum platform.",1
"the process of shifting ethereum to proof of stake required years of intense study and debate. the platform was founded in 2013 by a teenage software engineer, vitalik buterin, who remains one of the most influential people in the crypto industry. ethereum is now run by a loose network of coders from around the world. for months, they have gathered on video calls streamed on youtube to discuss the intricacies of the merge.",1
"the shift to proof of stake took so long partly because it required the construction of an entirely new blockchain — the public ledger where cryptocurrency transactions are recorded for all to see. that new chain, the beacon chain, was unveiled in december 2020. a series of tests followed this year.",1
"the internet has left plenty of dead and maimed paper-based institutions in its wake. if gavin andresen and his underground cadre of cypherpunks have their way, another archaic slice of pulped tree may be next: the dollar.",0
that possibly irrational exuberance may be a sign that bitcoin is headed for a speculative bubble. the currency already swings as much as 50% in value over some single days. but bitcoin's supporters are confident the free market can solve that problem as bitcoin's advantages attract more nonspeculative buying and selling.,1
"bitcoin is a grassroots nonprofit project that seeks to fashion a new currency out of little more than cryptography, networking and open-source software, and andresen is the closest thing the project has to a director. bitcoin is not, he explains, just a new way to digitally spend dollars, pounds and yen. that’s been tried before. remember beenz and flooz?",1
"as with shiny-metal-backed currencies, bitcoins derive their value partly through their scarcity, which is defined not by how much can be dug up with shovels but by a cryptographic lottery. anyone can get bitcoins without paying cash for them by downloading and running bitcoin’s “mining” program. the machines in bitcoin’s mining network, now in the thousands, compute an encryption function called a “hash” on a set of random numbers, and coins are awarded every ten minutes to whichever miner happens to compute a number below a certain threshold.",1
"that lottery tightly controls how many bitcoins are created. there are currently close to 6 million in existence. by 2014 there will be about twice that number. bitcoin’s distributed software is set to slow production over time so that there will never be more than 21 million in circulation. “no banker can control it. no evil dictator tyrant can print zillions and destroy the value,” says bruce wagner, organizer of new york’s bitcoin developer’s meet-up.",1
"thanks in part to its growing uses, both black- and white-market, the newborn currency is appreciating at a wild clip. in just the year since andresen joined the project, it’s jumped from half a penny in value to about a dollar.",1
one way they hope to bring more normals into the fold: by expanding bitcoin’s applications to the real world. bitcoin devotees in new york’s informal developer group are rolling out an android app for mobile bitcoin buying. they’re also building open-source software that can be integrated into point-of-sale terminals.,1
"“someday this will probably have the fed scrambling,” says the new york meet-up’s bruce wagner. “they still don’t know what twitter is. by the time they figure this out, it will have already taken hold.”",0

"earlier on monday, australian tech entrepreneur craig wright identified himself as the creator of bitcoin. experts were divided over whether he really was the elusive person who has gone by the name of satoshi nakamoto until now.",1
"the word stem crypto within the term cryptocurrency might be seen as surrogate for cryptography, but could also have emerged from the cypherpunk movement, who identified “anonymous cash and other untraceable payment systems” (de filippi & wright, 2018, p. 19) as enabling feature within a crypto-anarchy (ludlow, 2001, p. 4). bitcoin's mission of leveraging “cryptographic proof instead of trust” (nakamoto, 2008, p. 1) resonates with the above. the exact protocol specifications of bitcoin and its descendants are summarised in scheuermann and tschorsch (2016). cryptography enters its architecture in various ways. a few examples are the integrity of, and consensus on a joint transaction history as well as the authorisation setup for sending tokens. however, the use of the surrogate crypto for bitcoin is slightly arbitrary in the sense that earlier attempts at creating digital currencies (compare e.g. chaum, 1988) relied heavily on cryptographic techniques as well. nevertheless, it might seem justified by the fact that cryptography plays a far more central role for bitcoin than it does for national currencies.",1
"most ‘purchases’ conducted with bitcoin tokens, however, take the form of countertrade. the token, priced in fiat currency, is compared to a good or service, priced in fiat currency, and from this comparison of two fiat currency prices emerges an exchange ratio between the token and the good or service. this is the conceptual equivalent of superimposing a pair of two-way fiat currency transactions over each other and cancelling out the money flows, giving the residual appearance of the crypto-token being used as ‘money’ to ‘pay’ for a good or service.",1
"nevertheless, bitcoin is used primarily for speculation (baur, 2018)—buying the token with fiat currency with an intention to resell it for fiat currency—rather than using it to countertrade (‘pay’) for goods and services. this speculation (compare, among others, yermack, 2015; glaser et al., 2014; or cheah, 2015) drives volatility in the fiat currency price of tokens, which—when analysed through the lens of the conventional ‘functions of money’ paradigm favoured by economic textbooks (money as a medium-of-exchange, a store-of-value and a unit-of-account), poses problems for the ‘moneyness’ of the tokens. not only are they not widely accepted in exchange for goods and services, but they are not widely used to price things, and attempts to provide prices are unintuitive 3 (yermack, 2015). they also struggle to consistently ‘store value’, if we interpret that to mean ‘maintain stable purchasing power’ (which in the case of bitcoin means ‘maintain fiat price and countertrade ratios’). put simply, while a person can generally predict how many bags of sugar us$ 100 will command in a month, they will be very uncertain as to how much sugar they can obtain through bitcoin countertrade in a month.",1
"beyond these debates about the validity of the original use of the term cryptocurrency, the term has been destabilised by the proliferation of alterations to traditional cryptocurrency systems. the role of cryptography and ‘moneyness’ implied by the diverse token designs varies considerably and will be discussed in the remainder of the section.",1
"the broad trajectory in recent years, however, has been to decrease the centrality of cryptography in the respective implementations. even permissioned payment systems run by corporations but still called cryptocurrencies entered the stage. 4 eyal (2017) concludes that “if attendees at recent blockchain events are any indication, cryptocurrencies have caught the attention of the mainstream financial technology (fintech) sector” (eyal, 2017, p. 39). with traditional business starting to experiment with the technology inspired by bitcoin, system requirements—and with it the respective security setups and use of cryptography—changed. the economic design for these more centralised payment systems led to the reestablishment of trusted third parties or intermediaries for token creation to a certain degree.",1
"while many novel cryptocurrencies are far from the crypto-anarchist roots of archetypal token designs, the general idea of the replacement of trust in institutions or their internal governance mechanisms by cryptography still plays a role in all cryptocurrency designs. however, given that even fiat bank payments use cryptography for security, mere reliance on cryptography for security should not enter a definition of cryptocurrencies. 5",1
"early cryptocurrencies had the declared intent of creating ‘digital cash’ or currency (see section 1.1.), but the proliferation of crypto token forms have destabilised how this is conceptualised. not all development strands feature the objective of proposing general purpose monetary tokens.",1
"however, also ‘general purpose’ tokens are marked by changes. a response to the inherent instability in prices of archetypal cryptocurrency was the advent of ‘stablecoins’, which try to solve the issue of high volatility in purchasing power of bitcoin and its descendants (pernice, 2019). stablecoins are tethered or pegged to fiat currencies, or ‘backed’ in some way with assets that have fiat currency prices. they are thus no longer ‘blank’ empty signifiers, and contain some reference point that is easier to estimate and communicate. there are very different types of stablecoins, and recently several frameworks have tried to unify and abstract existing stabilisation techniques (e.g., bullmann et al., 2019; pernice et al., 2019; moin et al., 2020; sidorenko, 2019; clark et al., 2020). a national currency can be ‘tokenized’ by issuing a digital promise for it on a blockchain system, and such tokenised funds might indeed be categorised as a “new form of electronic money” (blandin et al., 2019) falling under the respective regulations for e-money, anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing regulations. this might ensure “moneyness” at least from a legal standpoint. with more complex stablecoin designs the legal case is not always clear, but from an economic standpoint their stability in purchasing power might contribute to an increase in their adoption as money in the future. stablecoins, for now however, haven’t seen mainstream adoption in retail markets yet (bullmann et al., 2019).",1
"many scientific publications simply assume the meaning of the term cryptocurrency to be common knowledge or, at most, sketch it roughly. 7 instead, we followed the evolution of the term starting with bitcoin to define what cryptocurrency is understood as today. the neologism cryptocurrency is unstable in its meaning, and is applied to systems with diverse technical architectures and governance systems. nevertheless, one way to unify the diverse uses of the term is to define it by some common intent among those who claim it, rather than by the diverse means via which that intent is enacted, and regardless of whether the intent is achieved in practice. we find that cryptocurrency systems are unified by being intended to host a general or limited-purpose medium-of-exchange, a cryptocurrency, using infrastructure that replaces trust in institutions by cryptography to varying degrees.",1
"to make the term more useful in public discourse, cryptocurrency should be coupled with specifying classifications from economic (e.g., bullmann et al., 2019; pernice et al., 2019; moin et al., 2020; clark et al., 2020), governance (e.g., ziolkowski et al., 2020; beck et al., 2018; hacker, 2019) or technological (e.g., cachin and vukoli, 2017; peters et al., 2016) points of view.",1

"the price of bitcoin has dropped by around half since its peak. more speculative projects, such as dogecoin, have fallen even further. while this may be discouraging to day traders and fast money types, for longer-term investors, there are exciting developments in cryptocurrency.",1
"for one thing, the drive continues toward more exchange-listed funds and trusts in the sector. there's also a key debate in a technical area: is the future of cryptocurrencies found in proof-of-stake protocols?",1
"the proof-of-work versus proof-of-stake issue comes down to this question: how to ensure the integrity of a cryptocurrency. most legacy cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, rely on a proof-of-work mechanism. when you see an image of thousands of computers in a mining facility, that's a proof-of-work operation. the computers solve complicated algorithmic puzzles. in return, the miners receive tokens of the underlying cryptocurrency as reward.",1
"proof-of-stake, by contrast, relies on validators to maintain the cryptocurrency. in a proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as collateral. in return, they get authority over the token in proportion to the amount they stake. generally, these token stakers get additional ownership in the token over time via network fees, newly minted tokens or other such reward mechanisms.",1
"in the beginning, proof-of-work was appealing because people just needed an ordinary computer to mine coins. nowadays, however, specialized expensive gear is needed to mine leading proof-of-work tokens. much of mining is now done by large, well-financed pools, which has cut out the general public from the equation.",0
"in the debate proof-of-stake versus proof-of-work battle, the former could be more democratic. anyone with tokens is able to participate as a validator or staker and tap into the decentralized finance (defi) ecosystem. more broadly, analysts have focused on the environmental burden from proof-of-work protocols. bitcoin, in particular, has developed a large environmental footprint as it has gained wider adoption. proof-of-stake, by cutting out the advanced cryptographic puzzles, reduces this environmental cost dramatically.",1
"proof-of-work advocates protest that proof-of-stake deviates from the original vision of cryptocurrency. bitcoin differentiated itself from other financial assets because the database or blockchain record was inherently valuable. the mining process, while inefficient in terms of energy, created a distinct and tamper-proof record of all financial transactions. proof-of-stake, at least in basic forms, has some vulnerabilities.",1
"the nothing at stake problem, for example, is centered around the fact that when there is no cost to creating forks or putting bad information into the consensus, it encourages malicious behavior. proof-of-work's energy cost inherently limits manipulation; proof-of-stake, by contrast, must use more sophisticated methods to try to stop these security issues.",0
"the proof-of-stake versus proof-of-work debate has largely stayed within the technical realm. proof-of-stake has a notable leader in cardano, but the biggest projects have stayed with proof-of-work. however, ethereum's plans to migrate from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake are bringing this subject into the spotlight. ethereum's move began in earnest in 2020, when ethereum launched its proof-of-stake beacon chain. development continues, with phase 1 aiming to launch later in 2021 and the full merge into proof-of-stake for ethereum happening over the next year.",0
"so, given the benefits of proof-of-stake, why has ethereum taken so long to make the switch? ""the main impediment for faster adoption of proof-of-stake has certainly been the difficulty of migrating the largest smart contract network ethereum from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake,"" says justin giudici, head of product at the telos foundation. ""the challenge of changing the consensus mechanism on ethereum has been compared to 'fixing a plane while flying it.' this is because with thousands of existing smart contracts on the ethereum chain along with billions of dollars in assets at stake, the migration challenge is significant.""",0
"here are some numbers to put the challenge in perspective. ""development on ethereum has far outpaced its ability to change and thus scale. it's easy to understand why when you consider the defi phenomenon, which saw an industry go from zero to $76 billion in the last year. then, during the first two quarters of 2021, non-fungible tokens exploded, bringing in $2.5 billion. building on the ethereum network has been happening at an explosive rate, while the switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake is a long, arduous process,"" says david waslen, ceo of rublix development, a blockchain and smart contract software company.",1
"it's easy to migrate from one technology to another in a vacuum. however, as ethereum's decentralized finance system has already gained wide adoption, it's vital to maintain continuous network stability. ""there could be unexpected critical bugs or circumstances that are difficult to predict before the merge occurs. this is a good reason for not rushing the transition,"" says mattias nystrom, community manager for the golem network.",1
"""ethereum's timeline can be seen as a product of its strength: decentralization. it's a complex project with lots of stakeholders and beyond that, it's censorship resistant and permissionless socially. this means anyone can join the project and give their input on changes to the network. so you need consensus among developers creating the code and among the wider community for things to progress,"" nystrom says.",1
"another factor is the recent decline in cryptocurrency prices, and the ensuing amount of mining power devoted to proof-of-work protocols. transaction fees on bitcoin, ethereum and other leading proof-of-work projects support the mining network. as crypto has dropped, transaction fees fell. but even if the average transaction fee drops from, say, $25 to $5, that can still be a huge cut of smaller decentralized finance transactions.",1
"also, as emerging markets such as el salvador adopt cryptocurrency, fees will need to come down dramatically. el salvador's gross domestic product per capita works out to around just $11 per day. so if cryptocurrency will be the default money in that economy, it's vital that user fees aren't a large portion of a worker's average daily wage.",1
"""there's a huge impact to innovation in languishing on slower, more expensive consensus technology. historically, the transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake and other high speed consensus models is comparable to the transition from dial-up internet to broadband,"" giudici says. ""quite simply, the number and types of use cases, level of adoption and impact of the technology go up orders of magnitude as entrepreneurs release products that couldn't even be imagined using slower more limited technology.""",0
"ethereum is supposed to adopt proof-of-stake over the next year. but like the switch from dial-up to broadband, don't be surprised if proof-of-stake still takes a while. ""even though the changeover from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake is beginning in 2021, the final result is a long way off. [ethereum founder] vitalik buterin has even pointed to an extended process of 'cleanup' after the scheduled hard forks and the eventual chain merge before the ethereum platform problems such as lack of scalability, costs and congestion can be aggressively addressed,"" waslen says.",1
"proof-of-stake has one other widely discussed effect: the graphics card market. as ethereum and other leading crypto projects adopt proof-of-stake systems, it should reduce the demand for graphics cards in for cryptographic mining. this could finally break the shortage in the area. that's great news for gamers.",1
"jahon jamali, co-founder of sarson funds, agrees that graphics card demand could free up with proof-of-stake adoption. however, the best proof-of-stake user benefit comes elsewhere. ""the big positive effect is that consumers get to participate in the consensus mechanism. it's more scalable and they can participate in the staking rewards. they will benefit greatly by being able to participate in a broader ecosystem,"" jamali says.",0
"and it's no guarantee that graphics card applications will decline in a proof-of-stake world. giudici suggests much of this crypto-mining infrastructure could go from supporting proof-of-work systems to other crypto-backed applications such as distributed research in fields such as cancer, alzheimer's disease and climate change. using a staking model, users could be rewarded with tokens for sharing their computing resources while also advancing a greater good beyond simply maintaining the bitcoin or ethereum networks.",1

"legendary cryptographer nick szabo says the only way to realise seamless, automated, and global financial integrity is if banks embrace permissionless blockchains, like the system bitcoin runs on.",1
"""but their bureaucracies are so heavily invested in the expertise and importance of local regulations and standards that it's extremely difficult for them to cut the gordian knot and implement seamless global systems.",0
"""so they keep trying to re-inject points of control, and thus points of vulnerability, into blockchains, e.g. through 'permissioning'; but this nullifies their main benefits, which come from removing points of vulnerability.""",1
"szabo reiterated the point: to remove vulnerability banks also have to remove individual human control and the individuals in charge or with root access. banks naturally hate that loss to their power. but they don't have any choice if they want to gain the benefits of having an army of independent computers that rigorously, constantly and securely check each others' work, he said.",0
"szabo pointed out that proper financial controls are already somewhat decentralised, thanks to a ""human blockchain"" of accountants, auditors, etc. checking each others' work.",1
"""there are half a dozen or so different entities involved when you do a stock trade on wall street, again checking each others' work. you typically see full vulnerability to unaccountable third parties only in pathological situations where naive newcomers try to do money on the centralised web, as with mt.gox.",1
"""but the traditional 'human blockchain' is very labor-intensive and very local — each is based on local regulations and customs and thus splits the world up into mutually untrusting national silos. permissionless blockchains cut through that like alexander cutting through the gordian knot.""",0
"szabo has a deep understanding of the way legal contracts and auditing systems work and has applied computing logic to these areas, famously coining the term ""smart contracts"" back in the 1990's.",0
ibtimes asked szabo if he expected smart contract execution and other decentralised apps on censorship-resistant systems like ethereum to challenge financial and legal institutions with a ferocity similar to that of bitcoin.,1
"""yes, eventually moreso, since ethereum's more flexible and general language can facilitate a much wider variety of commercial and other formal relationships.",1
"""however, the ethereum community needs to learn to reverse-engineer legal and other traditional patterns instead of trying to re-invent society from scratch. that will take some time to figure out how to do well. it will also take some time for the ethereum platform to technologically mature, as it has with bitcoin.""",1
"financial contracts that have clearly-defined rules and can be collateralised are generally viewed as low-hanging fruit within the brave new world of smart contracts. recently, ubs came out of the bushes with a smart bonds platform built on ethereum.",1
"szabo said bonds are good example of a financial instrument suited to smart contracts because they could be backed by other assets that exist on the blockchain, if the bond issuer itself fails to make a payment.",1
"""if it is secured by collateral that can be controlled digitally on or from the blockchain, that will be the most trust-minimised and most automated kind of interaction.",0
"""these can be performed predominantly by 'dry code' (interpreted by computers rather than lawyers) and thus automated and trust-minimised (vulnerability-minimised) for seamless operations across borders.",0
"""at the other end of the contractual spectrum, there are a wide variety of contracts where performances are inherently human in nature or where humans have tacit knowledge that isn't readily communicated to software. for example, paying an artist to create a work of art.",0
"""more prosaically, most construction contracts involve quality aspects that probably won't anytime soon be specified well enough for a robot to be able to judge whether the work has been satisfactorily completed. this kind of thing will long remain the domain of 'wet code' — traditional law interpreted by lawyers rather than computers.""",0
bitcoin transaction volumes are expected to increase in the years ahead and the debate over how and when to increase headroom (size of blocks are currently limited to 1mb) was in the headlines recently.,1
"szabo favours blockstream co-founder pieter wuille's proposal, a security-conscious approach using limiting-resource figures and scenarios which argues for about a 20% or less per year increase in block size.",0
"szabo provided the analogy of a ""box size debate"" over the number of dollar bills that could be fitted into an armoured car. one side of the debate says we should try to carry as many pieces of paper in the truck as possible in order to allow it to handle small denominations. they want to turn the armoured car into a big moving van, said szabo.",0
"the other side argues that truck should be smaller and heavily armoured. you can move more dollar bills in the moving van, much like visa can do many more transactions per second than bitcoin. to do that you have to remove some armour — you have to reduce the security.",1
"""you'd have to hire more security guards and money-counters instead, and you'd have to depend more on the local laws to protect you. with block size too, as with the 'box size' of our money-carrying truck, there is a security vs. performance trade-off.",1
"""if you reduce the redundancy of messages to allow for larger block sizes, beyond the growth of limiting-resource technology, that reduces the automated integrity that makes bitcoin distinctive in financial it.",1
"""it creates avenues of attack and it would end up becoming more dependent on the human blockchain of accountants, investigators and lawyers for its integrity. it would be more labour-intensive and nationally siloed like traditional it systems.""",0
"visa and paypal have much higher transactions per second than bitcoin (analogous to szabo's bigger truck moving more dollar bills), but they are more labour-intensive and often difficult to use across national borders.",1
"""if that's the tradeoff you want to make, visa and paypal already exist, and within national borders they do what they do quite well. it's silly to try to turn bitcoin into yet another visa and paypal,"" he said.",1
"""that means that large-b bitcoin (the blockchain) will evolve into a high-value settlement system: as it grows it won't turn into a big moving van carrying many more pieces of paper (transactions per second); instead it will be an armoured car that can carry higher denominations (higher value per transaction). that means we will need other systems to do small-b bitcoin (the currency) retail payments.""",1
"""it's completely reasonable, even if some bitcoin currency purists wouldn't like it, to have credit and debit card payments denominated in bitcoin rather than dollars, and net settled on bitcoin instead of on fedwire.",1

"bitcoin is a virtual, digital, or “crypto” currency—so called because of the cryptography, or unchangeable coding techniques, involved in the blockchain code on which they exist. the intent of bitcoin is to allow online payments to be made directly from one party to another through a worldwide payment system, without the need for a central third-party intermediary like a bank. bitcoin is not issued by any central bank or government and is still not considered legal tender (meaning a national currency established by statute) in most countries. like physical gold, bitcoin’s value stems from a combination of its perceived scarcity and the perception that it can be a store of value, an anonymous means of payment, or a hedge against inflation, though none of these characteristics have yet to establish a long-term track record.",1
"blockchain, the underlying technology that supports cryptocurrencies, is an open-source, public record-keeping system operating on a decentralized computer network (i.e., the internet) that records transactions between parties in a verifiable and permanent way. blockchain provides accountability, as the records are intended to be immutable, which presents potential applications for many businesses. while blockchain has often been associated with cryptocurrencies, it has many potential uses beyond payments, including smart contracts, supply chain management, and financial services. note that ownership of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies is not an investment in blockchain, the technology, or its current or future uses.",1

"with the onset of the information age, our nation is becoming increasingly dependent upon network communications. computer-based technology is significantly impacting our ability to access, store, and distribute information. among the most important uses of this technology is electronic commerce: performing financial transactions via electronic information exchanged over telecommunications lines. a key requirement for electronic commerce is the development of secure and efficient electronic payment systems. the need for security is highlighted by the rise of the internet, which promises to be a leading medium for future electronic commerce.",1
"the type of electronic payment system focused on in this paper is electronic cash. as the name implies, electronic cash is an attempt to construct an electronic payment system modelled after our paper cash system. paper cash has such features as being: portable (easily carried), recognizable (as legal tender) hence readily acceptable, transferable (without involvement of the financial network), untraceable (no record of where money is spent), anonymous (no record of who spent the money) and has the ability to make ""change."" the designers of electronic cash focused on preserving the features of untraceability and anonymity. thus, electronic cash is defined to be an electronic payment system that provides, in addition to the above security features, the properties of user anonymity and payment untraceability..",1
"in general, electronic cash schemes achieve these security goals via digital signatures. they can be considered the digital analog to a handwritten signature. digital signatures are based on public key cryptography. in such a cryptosystem, each user has a secret key and a public key. the secret key is used to create a digital signature and the public key is needed to verify the digital signature. to tell who has signed the information (also called the message), one must be certain one knows who owns a given public key. this is the problem of key management, and its solution requires some kind of authentication infrastructure. in addition, the system must have adequate network and physical security to safeguard the secrecy of the secret keys.",1
"this report has surveyed the academic literature for cryptographic techniques for implementing secure electronic cash systems. several innovative payment schemes providing user anonymity and payment untraceability have been found. although no particular payment system has been thoroughly analyzed, the cryptography itself appears to be sound and to deliver the promised anonymity.",1
"these schemes are far less satisfactory, however, from a law enforcement point of view. in particular, the dangers of money laundering and counterfeiting are potentially far more serious than with paper cash. these problems exist in any electronic payment system, but they are made much worse by the presence of anonymity. indeed, the widespread use of electronic cash would increase the vulnerability of the national financial system to information warfare attacks. we discuss measures to manage these risks; these steps, however, would have the effect of limiting the users' anonymity.",1
"this report is organized in the following manner. chapter 1 defines the basic concepts surrounding electronic payment systems and electronic cash. chapter 2 provides the reader with a high level cryptographic description of electronic cash protocols in terms of basic authentication mechanisms. chapter 3 technically describes specific implementations that have been proposed in the academic literature. in chapter 4, the optional features of transferability and divisibility for off-line electronic cash are presented. finally, in chapter 5 the security issues associated with electronic cash are discussed.",1
"the authors of this paper wish to acknowledge the following people for their contribution to this research effort through numerous discussions and review of this paper: kevin igoe, john petro, steve neal, and mel currie.",0
"we begin by carefully defining ""electronic cash."" this term is often applied to any electronic payment scheme that superficially resembles cash to the user. in fact, however, electronic cash is a specific kind of electronic payment scheme, defined by certain cryptographic properties. we now focus on these properties.",1
"the term electronic commerce refers to any financial transaction involving the electronic transmission of information. the packets of information being transmitted are commonly called electronic tokens. one should not confuse the token, which is a sequence of bits, with the physical media used to store and transmit the information.",1
"we will refer to the storage medium as a card since it commonly takes the form of a wallet-sized card made of plastic or cardboard. (two obvious examples are credit cards and atm cards.) however, the ""card"" could also be, e.g., a computer memory.",1
"a particular kind of electronic commerce is that of electronic payment. an electronic payment protocol is a series of transactions, at the end of which a payment has been made, using a token issued by a third party. the most common example is that of credit cards when an electronic approval process is used. note that our definition implies that neither payer nor payee issues the token.l",0
"with the rise of telecommunications and the internet, it is increasingly the case that electronic commerce takes place using a transmission medium not under the control of the financial system. it is therefore necessary to take steps to insure the security of the messages sent along such a medium.",1
"key management is carried out using a certification authority, or a trusted agent who is responsible for confirming a user's identity. this is done for each user (including banks) who is issued a digital identity certificate. the certificate can be used whenever the user wishes to identify herself to another user. in addition, the certificates make it possible to set up a private key between users in a secure and authenticated way. this private key is then used to encrypt subsequent messages. this technique can be implemented to provide any or all of the above security features.",1
"although the authentication infrastructure may be separate from the electronic-commerce setup, its security is an essential component of the security of the electronic-commerce system. without a trusted certification authority and a secure infrastructure, the above four security features cannot be achieved, and electronic commerce becomes impossible over an untrusted transmission medium.",0
"these features are not available with credit cards. indeed, the only conventional payment system offering it is cash. thus chaum and others have introduced electronic cash (or digital cash), an electronic payment system which offers both features. the sequence of events in an electronic cash payment is as follows:",0
"note that with an on-line system, the payment and deposit are not separate steps. we will refer to on-line cash and off-line cash schemes, omitting the word ""electronic"" since there is no danger of confusion with paper cash.",0
"as in any payment system, there is the potential here for criminal abuse, with the intention either of cheating the financial system or using the payment mechanism to facilitate some other crime. we will discuss some of these problems in 5. however, the issue of counterfeiting must be considered here, since the payment protocols contain built-in protections against it.",1
"one can deal with counterfeiting by trying to prevent it from happening, or by trying to detect it after the fact in a way that identifies the culprit. prevention clearly is preferable, all other things being equal.",1
"although it is tempting to imagine electronic cash systems in which the transmission and storage media are secure, there will certainly be applications where this is not the case. (an obvious example is the internet, whose users are notoriously vulnerable to viruses and eavesdropping.) thus we need techniques of dealing with counterfeiting other than physical security.",0
"the features of authenticity, anonymity, and multiple-spender exposure are achieved most conveniently using public-key cryptography. we will discuss how this is done in the next two chapters.",1
"in this chapter, we give a high-level description of electronic cash protocols in terms of basic authentication mechanisms. we begin by describing these mechanisms, which are based on public-key cryptography. we then build up the protocol gradually for ease of exposition. we start with a simplified scheme which provides no anonymity. we then incorporate the payment untraceability feature, and finally the payment anonymity property. the result will be a complete electronic cash protocol.",1
"one-way functions. a one-way function is a correspondence between two sets which can be computed efficiently in one direction but not the other. in other words, the function phi is one-way if, given s in the domain of phi, it is easy to compute t = phi(s), but given only t, it is hard to find s. (the elements are typically numbers, but could also be, e.g., points on an elliptic curve; see [10].)",0
"key pairs. if phi is a one-way function, then a key pair is a pair s, t related in some way via phi. we call s the secret key and t the public key. as the names imply, each user keeps his secret key to himself and makes his public key available to all. the secret key remains secret even when the public key is known, because the one-way property of phi insures that t cannot be computed from s.",0
"all public-key protocols use key pairs. for this reason, public-key cryptography is often called asymmetric cryptography. conventional cryptography is often called symmetric cryptography, since one can both encrypt and decrypt with the private key but do neither without it.",1
"signature and identification. in a public key system, a user identifies herself by proving that she knows her secret key without revealing it. this is done by performing some operation using the secret key which anyone can check or undo using the public key. this is called identification. if one uses a message as well as one's secret key, one is performing a digital signature on the message. the digital signature plays the same role as a handwritten signature: identifying the author of the message in a way which cannot be repudiated, and confirming the integrity of the message.",0
"secure hashing. a hash function is a map from all possible strings of bits of any length to a bit string of fixed length. such functions are often required to be collision-free: that is, it must be computationally difficult to find two inputs that hash to the same value. if a hash function is both one-way and collision-free, it is said to be a secure hash.",0
"the most common use of secure hash functions is in digital signatures. messages might come in any size, but a given public-key algorithm requires working in a set of fixed size. thus one hashes the message and signs the secure hash rather than the message itself. the hash is required to be one-way to prevent signature forgery, i.e., constructing a valid-looking signature of a message without using the secret key.4 the hash must be collision-free to prevent repudiation, i.e., denying having signed one message by producing another message with the same hash.",1
"4 note that token forgery is not the same thing as signature forgery. forging the bank's digital signature without knowing its secret key is one way of committing token forgery, but not the only way. a bank employee or hacker, for instance, could ""borrow"" the bank's secret key and validly sign a token. this key compromise scenario is discussed in 5.3.",1
"5 one should keep in mind that the term ""bank"" refers to the financial system that issues and clears the coins. for example, the bank might be a credit card company, or the overall banking system. in the latter case, alice and bob might have separate banks. if that is so, then the ""deposit"" procedure is a little more complicated: bob's bank contacts alice's bank, ""cashes in"" the coin, and puts the money in bob's account.",1
"the above protocols use digital signatures to achieve authenticity. the authenticity features could have been achieved in other ways, but we need to use digital signatures to allow for the anonymity mechanisms we are about to add.",0
"in this section, we modify the above protocols to include payment untraceability. for this, it is necessary that the bank not be able to link a specific withdrawal with a specific deposit.6 this is accomplished using a special kind of digital signature called a blind signature.",0
"we will give examples of blind signatures in 3.2, but for now we give only a high-level description. in the withdrawal step, the user changes the message to be signed using a random quantity. this step is called ""blinding"" the coin, and the random quantity is called the blinding factor. the bank signs this random-looking text, and the user removes the blinding factor. the user now has a legitimate electronic coin signed by the bank. the bank will see this coin when it is submitted for deposit, but will not know who withdrew it since the random blinding factors are unknown to the bank. (obviously, it will no longer be possible to do the checking of the withdrawal records that was an optional step in the first two protocols.)",0
"note that the bank does not know what it is signing in the withdrawal step. this introduces the possibility that the bank might be signing something other than what it is intending to sign. to prevent this, we specify that a bank's digital signature by a given secret key is valid only as authorizing a withdrawal of a fixed amount. for example, the bank could have one key for a $10 withdrawal, another for a $50 withdrawal, and so on.7",0
"7 0ne could also broaden the concept of ""blind signature"" to include interactive protocols where both parties contribute random elements to the message to be signed. an example of this is the ""randomized blind signature"" occurring in the ferguson scheme discussed in 3.3.",0
it turns out that this is too much to ask: there is no way in such a scenario for the consumer to obtain a signed receipt. thus we are forced to settle for payer anonymity.,0
"if the payment is to be on-line, we can use protocol 3 (implemented, of course, to allow for payer anonymity). in the off-line case, however, a new problem arises. if a merchant tries to deposit a previously spent coin, he will be turned down by the bank, but neither will know who the multiple spender was since she was anonymous. thus it is necessary for the bank to be able to identify a multiple spender. this feature, however, should preserve anonymity for law-abiding users.",0
"the solution is for the payment step to require the payer to have, in addition to her electronic coin, some sort of identifying information which she is to share with the payee. this information is split in such a way that any one piece reveals nothing about alice's identity, but any two pieces are sufficient to fully identify her.",1
"this information is created during the withdrawal step. the withdrawal protocol includes a step in which the bank verifies that the information is there and corresponds to alice and to the particular coin being created. (to preserve payer anonymity, the bank will not actually see the information, only verify that it is there.) alice carries the information along with the coin until she spends it.",1
"at the payment step, alice must reveal one piece of this information to bob. (thus only alice can spend the coin, since only she knows the information.) this revealing is done using a challenge-response protocol. in such a protocol, bob sends alice a random ""challenge"" quantity and, in response, alice returns a piece of identifying information. (the challenge quantity determines which piece she sends.) at the deposit step, the revealed piece is sent to the bank along with the coin. if all goes as it should, the identifying information will never point to alice. however, should she spend the coin twice, the bank will eventually obtain two copies of the same coin, each with a piece of identifying information. because of the randomness in the challenge-response protocol, these two pieces will be different. thus the bank will be able to identify her as the multiple spender. since only she can dispense identifying information, we know that her coin was not copied and re-spent by someone else.",1
"note that, in this protocol, bob must verify the bank's signature before giving alice the merchandise. in this way, bob can be sure that either he will be paid or he will learn alice's identity as a multiple spender.",1
"having described electronic cash in a high-level way, we now wish to describe the specific implementations that have been proposed in the literature. such implementations are for the off-line case; the on-line protocols are just simplifications of them. the first step is to discuss the various implementations of the public-key cryptographic tools we have described earlier.",0
we must first be more specific about how to include (and access when necessary) the identifying information meant to catch multiple spenders. there are two ways of doing it: the cut-and-choose method and zero-knowledge proofs.,0
"cut and choose. when alice wishes to make a withdrawal, she first constructs and blinds a message consisting of k pairs of numbers, where k is large enough that an event with probability 2-k will never happen in practice. these numbers have the property that one can identify alice given both pieces of a pair, but unmatched pieces are useless. she then obtains signature of this blinded message from the bank. (this is done in such a way that the bank can check that the k pairs of numbers are present and have the required properties, despite the blinding.)",0
"when alice spends her coins with bob, his challenge to her is a string of k random bits. for each bit, alice sends the appropriate piece of the corresponding pair. for example, if the bit string starts 0110. . ., then alice sends the first piece of the first pair, the second piece of the second pair, the second piece of the third pair, the first piece of the fourth pair, etc. when bob deposits the coin at the bank, he sends on these k pieces.",0
"if alice re-spends her coin, she is challenged a second time. since each challenge is a random bit string, the new challenge is bound to disagree with the old one in at least one bit. thus alice will have to reveal the other piece of the corresponding pair. when the bank receives the coin a second time, it takes the two pieces and combines them to reveal alice's identity.",0
"zero-knowledge proofs. the term zero-knowledge proof refers to any protocol in public-key cryptography that proves knowledge of some quantity without revealing it (or making it any easier to find it). in this case, alice creates a key pair such that the secret key points to her identity. (this is done in such a way the bank can check via the public key that the secret key in fact reveals her identity, despite the blinding.) in the payment protocol, she gives bob the public key as part of the electronic coin. she then proves to bob via a zero-knowledge proof that she possesses the corresponding secret key. if she responds to two distinct challenges, the identifying information can be put together to reveal the secret key and so her identity.",1
"our next step is to describe the digital signatures that have been used in the implementations of the above protocols, and the techniques that have been used to include identifying information.",0
"there are two kinds of digital signatures, and both kinds appear in electronic cash protocols. suppose the signer has a key pair and a message m to be signed.",1
rsa signatures. the most well-known signature with message recovery is the rsa signature. let n be a hard-to-factor integer. the secret signature key s and the public verification key v are exponents with the property that,1
"for all messages m. given v, it is easy to find s if one knows the factors of n but difficult otherwise. thus the ""vth power (mod n)"" map is a trapdoor one-way function. the signature of m is",0

"“in our view, you are witnessing nothing less than the waning of the modern age. it is a development driven by ruthless but hidden logic. more than we commonly understand, the next millennium will no longer be ‘modern.’ we say this not to imply that you face a savage or backward future, although that is possible, but to emphasize that the stage of history now opening will be qualitatively different from that into which you were born.",0
"something new is coming. just as farming societies differed in kind from hunting and gathering bands, and industrial societies differed radically from feudal or yeoman agricultural systems, so the new world to come will mark a radical departure from anything seen before.”",0
"published in 1997 from authors james dale davidson and lord william rees-mogg, “the sovereign individual” can best be described as a guidebook. the authors combine a deep investigation into the history of man with a careful analysis of praxeology, or the study of human action, to come to a startling conclusion: our civilization is standing at the precipice of radical change. those who recognize this change and take the proper actions will benefit immensely, while those who remain ignorant will suffer the consequences.",0
"the book can also be viewed as a prophecy, making bold predictions about the future of civilization, many of which have already come to pass. a quarter of a century ago, while “experts” such as paul krugman were predicting that the internet would have little impact on the economy, davidson and rees-mogg were predicting the emergence of the cybereconomy; non-state digital money; personalized media; the convergence of the telephone, computer and tv into a single device; as well as the record level of public distrust in major institutions currently unfolding before our eyes.",0
"while religious and allegorical themes are beautifully woven throughout the book, the authors make it very clear that their thesis is rooted in hard logic, specifically a concept they call “the logic of violence.”",0
"throughout all of history, humans have had to deal with the simple truth that taking is often easier than making. working hard to acquire possessions such as food, shelter and clothing means nothing if they cannot be protected.",0
"the available methods by which humans have defended themselves and their property have transformed drastically from the time of hunter-gatherers up until the present day. in the authors’ views, it is this transformation of the logic of violence that is at the root of all major societal change throughout history.",0
"the fundamental axiom of the book is this: human action is guided by incentives. if we can become conscious of the incentives, then we can, to a certain extent, forecast human action. for example, dropping a $100 bill on the ground of any city in the world will produce very predictable results: someone will quickly pick it up.",0
"“the concept of megapolitics helps illuminate some of the major mysteries of history: how governments rise and fall and what types of institutions they become; the timing and outcome of wars; and patterns of economic prosperity and decline. by raising or lowering the costs and rewards of projecting power, megapolitics governs the ability of people to impose their will on others.”",0
"unlike manmade political institutions, megapolitics exist outside of the realm of conscious direction. davidson and rees-mogg describe the four basic types of megapolitical forces as being topography, climate, microbes and technology. of these four, technology is described as “having played by far the largest role in determining the costs and rewards of projecting power during the modern centuries.”",0
"it is the authors’ belief that the emergence of cryptography in conjunction with the borderless jurisdiction of cyberspace was poised to drastically alter the logic of violence, and therefore shift the balance of power from the state to the individual.",1
read as the authors describe in detail the eventual emergence of what they call “cybercash” and keep in mind that all this was first published in 1997:,1
"“now the advent of the information age implies another revolution in the character of money. as cybercommerce begins, it will lead inevitably to cybermoney. this new form of money will reset the odds, reducing the capacity of the world's nationstates to determine who becomes a sovereign individual. a crucial part of this change will come about because of the effect of information technology in liberating the holders of wealth from expropriation through inflation. soon, you will pay for almost any transaction over the net the same time you place it, using cybercash. this new digital form of money is destined to play a pivotal role in cybercommerce. it will consist of encrypted sequences of multihundred-digit prime numbers. unique, anonymous, and verifiable, this money will accommodate the largest transactions. it will also be divisible into the tiniest fraction of value. it will be tradable at a keystroke in a multi-trillion-dollar wholesale market without borders.”",0
"bitcoin has turned this 1997 prophecy into a reality. bitcoin will be the most important tool in the arsenal of the 21st century sovereign individual. impervious to confiscation via theft or inflation, and open to all human beings on earth with access to the internet, the rise of bitcoin represents the rise of the sovereign individual.",1
"sovereignty in this context is a zero-sum game. when individuals gain sovereignty, the state necessarily loses sovereignty over them. as citizens continue to take advantage of new technological innovations, institutions will naturally struggle to reclaim power.",0
"we are not only seeing this with bitcoin in the form of propaganda-style attacks launched by many central banks, but we are seeing it in legacy media as well. in the words of “the sovereign individual,” “the mass media will become individualized media… no longer will you be at the mercy of dan rather or the bbc for the news that reaches you. you will be able to select news compiled and edited according to your instructions.”",1
"with the rise of alternative, independent and social media, the mainstream media has never held less power than it does today. legacy news organizations are so desperate for significance that they do not hesitate to lie, manipulate and sow fear and hatred among its viewers in exchange for cheap clicks and views. so many of the biggest issues in society are kept alive by the mainstream media’s incessant desperation for relevance.",0
"cnn’s recent spat with joe rogan provides us a real time example of legacy media’s waning influence. rogan, a single man, was able to expose cnn’s lies about him by the simple virtue of the fact that he, himself, has a larger audience than cnn does.",0
"we are entering a world where all voices will have the opportunity to be heard. the internet is providing each human being a chance to live up to their full potential. geography, social class, gender and other labels are no longer limitations in the new digital world. the internet doesn’t care what you look like. if you are able to provide value, you will be rewarded.",0
"as fascinating and impressive as the authors’ use of logic to accurately predict many aspects of our modern life is, perhaps equally fascinating is their ability to look into the deeper, more mysterious patterns of history.",0
"“giggle if you will, but we do not despise or dismiss intuitive understandings of history. although our argument is grounded in logic, not in reveries, we are awed by the prophetic power of human consciousness... understanding the way the world works means developing a realistic intuition of the way that human society obeys the mathematics of natural processes. reality is nonlinear. but most people's expectations are not. to understand the dynamics of change, you have to recognize that human society, like other complex systems in nature, is characterized by cycles and discontinuities. that means certain features of history have a tendency to repeat themselves, and the most important changes, when they occur, may be abrupt rather than gradual.”",0
"the pattern they are referring to is a curious 500-year cycle which seems to correlate with paradigm shifting events in western civilization. beginning in 500 bc, the emergence of greek democracy and philosophy laid the foundations of western civilization. the birth of christ in 4 bc, during the height of the roman empire, set the stage for judeo-christian values becoming the bedrock of western culture.",0
"five centuries later, in 500 ad, the fall of rome would lead to the dark ages in western europe, a period of institutional collapse and lawless disarray. 1,000 ad marks the beginning of a period now known as the middle ages in which commerce and literacy were rediscovered. in the words of raoul glaber, an 11th century historian quoted by “the sovereign individual,” the turn of the millennium “shook off the tatters of antiquity.”",0
"500 years later, around the year 1,500, the renaissance, the reformation and the discovery of the new world all contributed to what we view as the commencement of the modern era.",0
"now, here we sit 500 years later in the very early stages of the 21st century. technological advances are being compounded exponentially. the era which gave birth to our modern notion of the nation state around the year 1,500 is coming to an end. as the balance of power shifts from the institutional level to the individual level, we would expect the legacy system to tighten its grip. this is exactly what we’re seeing.",0
"simply questioning the official story given by the state or mainstream media can result in being labeled a dangerous conspiracy theorist. attempting to create a dialogue about important issues on social media can result in censorship and re-education. suddenly, the inalienable right of bodily sovereignty encoded at nuremberg is being revoked by governments throughout the world.",0
"citizens of many countries are literally trapped within the borders, unable to leave unless granted permission by their government. innocent australians are being removed from their homes and shipped in buses to internment camps where they are being held in isolation, and then hunted down when they try to escape back to their families.",0
"unable to fund these operations against their citizens via transparent taxation, governments and central banks throughout the world have resorted to printing exorbitant amounts of money resulting in the highest inflation in decades.",1
"the mainstream media tells you this is all normal, the government tells you this is all normal, the big tech monopolies tell you this is all normal. however, to anyone paying any attention at all, it is becoming abundantly clear that the emperor has no clothes.",0
"as unsettling as all this may be, it is all a part of a natural process. metamorphosis requires death and rebirth. old institutions are dying, and the madness we are witnessing all around us is simply evidence of their accelerating decay. just as gutenberg's printing press broke the catholic church’s monopoly on information five centuries ago, bitcoin is poised to break the state’s monopoly on money.",1
"the stage is already set: insolvent governments will continue to print money in an effort to maintain control over their subjects. the savings of millions of responsible people throughout the world will be wiped out as the value of paper trends towards zero. many unwitting people will go down with the ship. but for the rest of us, a bright orange lifeboat awaits.",1
"i am fascinated by tim may's crypto-anarchy. unlike the communities traditionally associated with the word ""anarchy"", in a crypto-anarchy the government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary. it's a community where the threat of violence is impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical locations.  until now it's not clear, even theoretically, how such a community could operate. a community is defined by the cooperation of its participants, and efficient cooperation requires a medium of exchange (money) and a way to enforce contracts. traditionally these services have been provided by the government or government sponsored institutions and only to legal entities. in this article i describe a protocol by which these services can be provided to and by untraceable entities.  i will actually describe two protocols. the first one is impractical, because it makes heavy use of a synchronous and unjammable anonymous broadcast channel. however it will motivate the second, more practical protocol. in both cases i will assume the existence of an untraceable network, where senders and receivers are identified only by digital pseudonyms (i.e. public keys) and every messages is signed by its sender and encrypted to its receiver.  in the first protocol, every participant maintains a (seperate) database of how much money belongs to each pseudonym. these accounts collectively define the ownership of money, and how these accounts are updated is the subject of this protocol.  1. the creation of money. anyone can create money by broadcasting the solution to a previously unsolved computational problem. the only conditions are that it must be easy to determine how much computing effort it took to solve the problem and the solution must otherwise have no value, either practical or intellectual. the number of monetary units created is equal to the cost of the computing effort in terms of a standard basket of commodities. for example if a problem takes 100 hours to solve on the computer that solves it most economically, and it takes 3 standard baskets to purchase 100 hours of computing time on that computer on the open market, then upon the broadcast of the solution to that problem everyone credits the broadcaster's account by 3 units.  2. the transfer of money. if alice (owner of pseudonym k_a) wishes to transfer x units of money to bob (owner of pseudonym k_b), she broadcasts the message ""i give x units of money to k_b"" signed by k_a. upon the broadcast of this message, everyone debits k_a's account by x units and credits k_b's account by x units, unless this would create a negative balance in k_a's account in which case the message is ignored.  3. the effecting of contracts. a valid contract must include a maximum reparation in case of default for each participant party to it. it should also include a party who will perform arbitration should there be a dispute. all parties to a contract including the arbitrator must broadcast their signatures of it before it becomes effective. upon the broadcast of the contract and all signatures, every participant debits the account of each party by the amount of his maximum reparation and credits a special account identified by a secure hash of the contract by the sum the maximum reparations. the contract becomes effective if the debits succeed for every party without producing a negative balance, otherwise the contract is ignored and the accounts are rolled back. a sample contract might look like this:  k_a agrees to send k_b the solution to problem p before 0:0:0 1/1/2000. k_b agrees to pay k_a 100 mu (monetary units) before 0:0:0 1/1/2000. k_c agrees to perform arbitration in case of dispute. k_a agrees to pay a maximum of 1000 mu in case of default. k_b agrees to pay a maximum of 200 mu in case of default. k_c agrees to pay a maximum of 500 mu in case of default.  4. the conclusion of contracts. if a contract concludes without dispute, each party broadcasts a signed message ""the contract with sha-1 hash h concludes without reparations."" or possibly ""the contract with sha-1 hash h concludes with the following reparations: ..."" upon the broadcast of all signatures, every participant credits the account of each party by the amount of his maximum reparation, removes the contract account, then credits or debits the account of each party according to the reparation schedule if there is one.  5. the enforcement of contracts. if the parties to a contract cannot agree on an appropriate conclusion even with the help of the arbitrator, each party broadcasts a suggested reparation/fine schedule and any arguments or evidence in his favor. each participant makes a determination as to the actual reparations and/or fines, and modifies his accounts accordingly.  in the second protocol, the accounts of who has how much money are kept by a subset of the participants (called servers from now on) instead of everyone. these servers are linked by a usenet-style broadcast channel. the format of transaction messages broadcasted on this channel remain the same as in the first protocol, but the affected participants of each transaction should verify that the message has been received and successfully processed by a randomly selected subset of the servers.  since the servers must be trusted to a degree, some mechanism is needed to keep them honest. each server is required to deposit a certain amount of money in a special account to be used as potential fines or rewards for proof of misconduct. also, each server must periodically publish and commit to its current money creation and money ownership databases. each participant should verify that his own account balances are correct and that the sum of the account balances is not greater than the total amount of money created. this prevents the servers, even in total collusion, from permanently and costlessly expanding the money supply. new servers can also use the published databases to synchronize with existing servers.  the protocol proposed in this article allows untraceable pseudonymous entities to cooperate with each other more efficiently, by providing them with a medium of exchange and a method of enforcing contracts. the protocol can probably be made more efficient and secure, but i hope this is a step toward making crypto-anarchy a practical as well as theoretical possibility.  -------  appendix a: alternative b-money creation  one of the more problematic parts in the b-money protocol is money creation. this part of the protocol requires that all of the account keepers decide and agree on the cost of particular computations. unfortunately because computing technology tends to advance rapidly and not always publicly, this information may be unavailable, inaccurate, or outdated, all of which would cause serious problems for the protocol.  so i propose an alternative money creation subprotocol, in which account keepers (everyone in the first protocol, or the servers in the second protocol) instead decide and agree on the amount of b-money to be created each period, with the cost of creating that money determined by an auction. each money creation period is divided up into four phases, as follows:  1. planning. the account keepers compute and negotiate with each other to determine an optimal increase in the money supply for the next period.  whether or not the account keepers can reach a consensus, they each broadcast their money creation quota and any macroeconomic calculations done to support the figures.   2. bidding. anyone who wants to create b-money broadcasts a bid in the form of  where x is the amount of b-money he wants to create, and y is an unsolved problem from a predetermined problem class. each problem in this class should have a nominal cost (in mips-years say) which is publicly agreed on.  3. computation. after seeing the bids, the ones who placed bids in the bidding phase may now solve the problems in their bids and broadcast the solutions.  4. money creation. each account keeper accepts the highest bids (among those who actually broadcasted solutions) in terms of nominal cost per unit of b-money created and credits the bidders' accounts accordingly.",0
"there’s nothing like a dollar bill for paying a stripper. anonymous, yet highly personal—wherever you use it, that dollar will fit the occasion. purveyors of internet smut, after years of hiding charges on credit cards, or just giving it away for free, recently found their own version of the dollar—a new digital currency called bitcoin.",1
"you’ll know it when you see it (strippers who accept tips in bitcoins advertise their account addresses right on their bodies). and more important, if you pay with it, no one needs to know. bitcoin balances can flow between accounts without a bank, credit card company, or any other central authority knowing who is paying whom. instead, bitcoin relies on a peer-to-peer network, and it doesn’t care who you are or what you’re buying.",1
"you may have heard about bitcoin last year, when the digital currency was briefly a major media story and speculators rushed to cash in on the rising value of bitcoins. or perhaps you heard about hackers raiding the coffers of the largest online bitcoin exchanges, which coincided with the price of bitcoins plunging. since january bitcoin has stabilized. it’s been holding an exchange rate of about us $5.",1
"hughes and may were deeply aware that financial behavior communicates as much about you as words can—if not more. but outside of cash transactions or barter, there’s no such thing as a private transaction. we rely on banks, credit card companies, and other intermediaries to keep our financial system running. will those corporations save and even share a dossier of your spending habits? even using cash requires trust that the bill will maintain its worth. will governments print too much currency or too little? many cypherpunks would say that the only way to answer these questions is to build an entirely new system.",1
"gradually, their mistrust germinated into an anarchist philosophy. most simply wanted to be able to buy things without someone looking over their shoulders. but others on the mailing list imagined liberating currency from governmental control and then using it to lash back at their perceived oppressors.",0
"jim bell, a onetime intel engineer, took these fancies further than anyone, introducing the world to an odious thought experiment called an assassination market. citizens needed an effective way to punish politicians who acted against the wishes of their constituents, he reasoned, and what better punishment than murder? with an anonymous digital coin, argued bell, you could pool donations from disgruntled citizens into what amounts to bounties. if a politician made enough people angry, it would only be a matter of time before the price pushed him out of office or cost him his life. bell’s essay, “assassination politics,” eventually attracted the attention of federal agents. his spiral through the u.s. court system started with an irs raid in 1997 and ended this march with his release from prison.",1
"while cypherpunks like bell were dreaming up potential uses for digital currencies, others were more focused on working out the technical problems. wei dai had just graduated from the university of washington with a degree in computer science when he created b-money in 1998. “my motivation for b-money was to enable online economies that are purely voluntary,” says dai, “ones that couldn’t be taxed or regulated through the threat of force.” but b-money was a purely personal project, more conceptual than practical.",0
"in szabo’s bit gold scheme, a participant would dedicate computer power to solving cryptographic equations assigned by the system. “anything that works well as a proof-of-work function, producing a specific binary string such that it can be proved that generating that string was computationally costly, will work,” says szabo. in a bit gold network, solved equations would be sent to the community, and if accepted, the work would be credited to the person who had done it. each solution would become part of the next challenge, creating a growing chain of new property. this aspect of the system provided a clever way for the network to verify and time-stamp new coins, because unless a majority of the parties agreed to accept new solutions, they couldn’t start on the next equation.",1
"when attempting to design transactions with a digital coin, you run into the “double-spending problem.” once data have been created, reproducing them is a simple matter of copying and pasting. most e-cash scenarios solve the problem by relinquishing some control to a central authority, which keeps track of each account’s balance. digicash, an early form of digital money based on the pioneering cryptography of david chaum, handed this oversight to banks. this was an unacceptable solution for szabo. “i was trying to mimic as closely as possible in cyberspace the security and trust characteristics of gold, and chief among those is that it doesn’t depend on a trusted central authority,” he says.",0
"bit gold proved that it was possible to turn solutions to difficult computations into property in a decentralized fashion. but property is not quite cash, and the proposal left many problems unsolved. how do you assign proper value to different strings of data if they are not equally difficult to make? how do you encourage people to recognize this value and adopt the currency? and what system controls the transfer of currency between people?",0
"after b-money and bit gold failed to garner widespread support, the e-money scene got pretty quiet. and then, in 2008, along came a mysterious figure who wrote under the name “satoshi nakamoto,” with a proposal for something called bitcoin. as is fitting for the creator of a private digital currency, nakamoto’s true identity remains a secret. “i’ve never heard of anybody who knew about that name earlier,” says szabo. “and i’m not going to speculate on who he may or may not be.”",1
"to create a working system, nakamoto started with the idea of a chain of data, similar to bit gold. but rather than creating a chain of digital property, bitcoin records a chain of transactions.",1
"the simplest way to understand bitcoin is to think of it as a digital ledger book. imagine a bunch of people at a table who all have real-time access to the same financial ledger on laptops in front of them. the ledger records how many bitcoins each person at the table has at a given time. by necessity, the balance of each account is public information, and if one person wants to transfer funds to the person sitting across from him, he has to announce that transaction to everyone at the table. the entire group then appends the transaction to the ledger, which they all need to agree on. in a system like this, money never has to exist in a physical form, and yet it can’t be spent twice.",1
"this is basically how bitcoin works, except that the participants are spread across a global peer-to-peer network, and all transactions take place between addresses on the network rather than individuals. address ownership is verified through public-key cryptography, without revealing who the owner is.",1
"people who own bitcoins have a program—called the bitcoin client—installed on their computers to manage their accounts. when they want to access their funds, they use the client to send a transaction request. the innovation of bitcoin is to use the processing of these transaction requests as the mechanism for creating new currency.",1
"as requests pile up in the system, individual computers, running “mining” programs, bundle them into chunks called transaction blocks. before each block of transactions becomes part of the accepted bitcoin ledger, or block chain, the mining software must transform the data using cryptographic hash equations. the bitcoin client accepts the resulting hash values only if they meet strict criteria, so miners typically need to compute many hash values before stumbling upon one that meets the requirements. that process costs a lot of computing power—so much that it would be prohibitively difficult for anyone to come along and redo the work. each new block that gets added and sealed strengthens all the previous blocks on the chain.",1
"the “miner” whose computer first finds an acceptable hash value is rewarded with newly minted bitcoins. the bitcoin system adjusts the difficulty of the hashing requirements to control the minting rate. to its proponents, this is one of bitcoin’s biggest attractions: unlike the printing of “fiat” currency, which can be done on demand, the creation of bitcoins will gradually taper until it reaches a limit of 21 million coins.",1
"as more and more miners compete to process transactions, mining requires more computing power. brock tice, who mines bitcoins in st. paul, minn., has a whole room stuffed full of enough mining computers to heat his office in the winter. but tice first became interested in the network for a different reason. he thought it would be a better way to accept money from customers online.",1
"in 2009, he began selling little blue canary-shaped night-lights from his home in new mexico. he quickly lost patience with all the standard payment options. “i had been thinking for a while that something like bitcoin was needed,” he says. “i run a couple of small businesses, and taking or making payments is just such a huge pain.” every time a customer pays with paypal, for instance, tice hands over 2.9 percent of what he charges plus a small fee. for international sales, he pays even more. the rates for google checkout and credit cards are about the same, and for each one he has to open an account with the company processing the transaction, and then trust that it will eventually hand over the money. after reading about how bitcoin works, tice decided to include it as a payment method on his website.",1
"for merchants like tice, the benefits are obvious. in addition to relieving him of fees (at least for now—bitcoin has an optional mechanism in place for miners to collect fees in the future), bitcoin transactions won’t open him up to claims of credit card fraud. in bitcoin, all transactions are irreversible.",1
"on the other hand, unlike credit card users, consumers paying with bitcoins have no way to get their money back if tice never ships the item. but as with any financial transaction, some level of trust is still required. and some customers would prefer to trust a merchant to make good on a sale than trust them to protect sensitive data. last spring, hackers broke into the sony playstation network and swiped a trove of private account details—credit card numbers, birthdays, log-ins, passwords, home addresses, and all the names associated with them. just days later, it happened again, and within a week the security of more than 100 million sony accounts was at risk. “i think bitcoin really has the potential to change our expectations about what information we give merchants,” says gavin andresen, bitcoin’s project leader.",1
"the bitcoin system has had its own hacking problems. other than a few die-hard miners, most people buy bitcoins at an exchange where you pay dollars, euros, or whatever and get bitcoins in return. these exchanges also allow merchants to convert their bitcoin collections into other currencies. unfortunately, the security of the exchanges hasn’t been as good as the bitcoin client itself. the largest online exchange, mt. gox, lost 500 000 bitcoins to hackers in june 2011, which sent the price barreling down. anyone who invests in a bitcoin better understand that it’s going to be more volatile than the dollar, says michael kagan, the managing director at clearbridge advisors, an investment firm in new york city.",1
"even with the ups and downs, many of bitcoin’s early adopters amassed their virtual fortunes when mining was easy, so they have an incentive to keep the system going (assuming they didn’t cash out at the peak of the bubble). it’s possible they are hoarding the currency, as the economist paul krugman speculated they would, waiting for the price to rise again as mining becomes more competitive and expensive. and while bitcoin’s fixed minting rate helped attract its most fervent early adopters, it also made the barrier to entry much higher for people who want to join now. “if anything is the achilles’ heel of bitcoin, that probably is it,” szabo says.",1
"if bitcoin does fail, it may die in an act of cannibalism. nakamoto introduced the block chain, but cryptographers are now already working on improvements. the minting rate is only one of many things that could be tweaked. “bitcoin is the first of a new breed,” says garzik. “people will learn from bitcoin and build something better, or bitcoin’s critical mass will force it to evolve and learn from its own mistakes.”",1
"morgen e. peck never saw the point in writing about money or finance. then she attended a conference on the cryptocurrency bitcoin and talked to anarchists, programmers, bankers, cryptographers, libertarians, finance lawyers, and a game show host. from this crucible of ideas, she emerged quite altered. “i’d like to personally thank satoshi nakamoto [bitcoin’s supposed creator] for finally making money interesting enough to write about,” she says.",1

"particle physicists have long been early adopters—if not inventors—of tech from email to the internet. it’s not surprising, then, that as early as 1997, researchers were training computer models to tag particles in the messy jets created during collisions. since then these models have chugged along, growing steadily more competent—though not to everyone’s delight.",0
"“i felt very threatened by machine learning,” says jesse thaler, a theoretical particle physicist at the massachusetts institute of technology. initially, he says he felt like it jeopardized his human expertise classifying particle jets. but thaler has since come to embrace it, applying machine learning (ml) to a variety of problems across particle physics. “machine learning is a collaborator,” he says.",0
"over the past decade, in tandem with the broaderdeep learning revolution, particle physicists have trained algorithms to solve previously intractable problems and tackle completely new challenges.",0
"even with an efficient trigger, the lhc must store 600 petabytes over the next few years of data collection. so researchers are investigating strategies to compress the data.",0
"for starters, particle physics data is very different than the typical data used in machine learning. though convolutional neural nets (cnns) have proven extremely effective at classifying images of everyday objects from trees to cats to food, they’re less suited for particle collisions. the problem, according to javier duarte, a particle physicist at the university of california, san diego, is that collision data such as that from the large hadron collider, isn’t naturally an image.",0
"flashy depictions of collisions at the lhc can misleadingly fill up the entire detector. in reality, only a few out of millions of inputs are registering a signal, like a white screen with a few black pixels. this sparsely populated data makes for a poor image, but it can work well in a different, newer framework—graph neural networks (gnns).",0
"other challenges from particle physics require innovation. “we’re not just importing hammers to hit our nails,” says daniel whiteson, a particle physicist at the university of california, irvine. “we have new weird kinds of nails that require the invention of new hammers.” one weird nail is the sheer amount of data produced at the lhc—about one petabyte per second. of this enormous amount, only a small bit of high quality data is saved. to create a better trigger system, which saves as much good data as possible while getting rid of low quality data, researchers want to train a sharp-eyed algorithm to sort better than one that’s hard-coded.",0
"but to be effective, such an algorithm would need to be incredibly speedy, executing in microseconds, duarte says. to address these problems, particle physicists are pushing the limits of machine techniques like pruning and quantization, to make their algorithms even faster. even with an efficient trigger, the lhc must store 600 petabytes over the next few years of data collection (equivalent to about 660,000 movies at 4k resolution or the data equivalent of 30 libraries of congress), so researchers are investigating strategies to compress the data.",0
"“we’d like to have a machine learn to think more like a physicist, [but] we also just need to learn how to think a little bit more like a machine.”—jesse thaler, mit",0
"machine learning is also allowing particle physicists to think about the data they use differently. instead of focusing on a single event—say, a higgs boson decaying to two photons—they are learning to consider the dozens of other events that happen during a collision. although there’s no causal relationship between any two events, researchers like thaler are now embracing a more holistic view of the data, not just the piecemeal point-of-view that comes from analyzing events interaction by interaction.",0
"more dramatically, machine learning has also forced physicists to reassess basic concepts. “i was imprecise in my own thinking about what a symmetry was,” thaler says. “forcing myself to teach a computer what a symmetry was, helped me understand what a symmetry actually is.” symmetries require a reference frame—in other words, is the image of a distorted sphere in a mirror actually symmetrical? there’s no way of knowing without knowing if the mirror itself is distorted.",0
"these are still early days for machine learning in particle physics, and researchers are effectively treating the technique like a proverbial kitchen sink. “it may not be the right fit for every single problem in particle physics,” admits duarte.",0
"as some particle physicists delve deeper into ml, an uncomfortable question rears its head: are they doing physics, or computer science? stigma against coding—sometimes not considered to be “real physics”—already exists; similar concerns swirl around ml. one worry is that ml will obscure the physics, turning analysis into a black box of automated processes opaque to human understanding.",0
"“our goal is not to plug in the machine, the experiment to the network and have it publish our papers so we’re out of the loop,” whiteson says. he and colleagues are working to have the algorithms provide feedback in language humans can understand—but algorithms may not be the only ones with responsibilities to communicate.",0
"“on the one hand, we’d like to have a machine learn to think more like a physicist, [but] we also just need to learn how to think a little bit more like a machine,” thaler says. “we need to learn to speak each other’s language.”",0

[accredited investors include registered investment companies and individuals whose net worth exceeds $1 million]. other exchanges go for one or two states, they say we'll register with the feds, which is easy, and then get licenses in, say, california and new york and serve those customers.",1
"garzik: i was a kernel engineer with red hat. what i was doing there is remarkably analogous to what i'm doing now. red hat paid me but they didn't tell me what to work on, they paid me to be an os engineer and contribute to linux, so i would send my changes to linus torvalds. same thing here, bitpay isn't paying me to work on bitpay, they're paying me to work on open source.",0
"garzik: a lot of people are into the whole libertarian aspect, i think of it more as an interesting engineering project. when i first heard about bitcoin, i thought it was impossible. how can you have a purely digital currency? can't i just copy your hard drive and have your bitcoins? i didn't understand how that could be done, and then i looked into it and it was brilliant.",0
"idgns: there's a lot of powerful hardware coming onto the market for mining bitcoins [mining is how new bitcoins enter the system]. what is there to stop, say, google from loading the bitcoin software into one of its data centers and mining all the remaining bitcoins?",0
"garzik: technically nothing, but in practice cpus are powerless against asics [custom chips designed specifically for bitcoin mining]. google would have to manufacture its own asics for that to have an impact, and that's never really been a worry. the worry now is who controls the foundries that produce the chips, so you have to think a couple of levels up.",1
"garzik: yeah, you have companies designing the asics and then the chip foundries make them. who's to say the foundry won't simply produce a million chips on top of your thousand-chip order?",0
"garzik: there are enough people who are pursuing asics that it isn't likely, but that's the current battle over decentralization of mining, that and mining pools.",0
"garzik: i would never recommend bitcoin as a nation state currency that you're forced to use, but i think it's great as a private currency that you're free to choose if you want to. it's just very frictionless, you can trade it with free software.",1
"the biggest hurdle may be the volatility, as you suggested. for regular users, i agree that's off-putting to a certain extent. i think it's something that will diminish over time, but it's a free market so there's no guarantee. just introducing new people to bitcoin is hard as well. it's technologically complex, how do i explain it to my aunt? but then, to a certain extent you don't have to understand it, you can download a bitcoin wallet in the android market, scan a qr code and you have bitcoins.",1
"garzik: in the early days, when we had wikileaks wanting to use bitcoins for donations, satoshi came up on the forum and said, please don't do that, it's a system in its infancy, we don't need all this conflict and controversy right now.",1
"garzik: the stock answer is no, it's pseudo-anonymous, sort of like a swiss bank account, it's a number. but if you go through a lot of effort it can be anonymous.",0
"garzik: you'd have to use tor, and if you send me bitcoins and another person sends me bitcoins, i have to sort of keep those in two separate pools. if i spend them both together, a network analysis can tie you, the other person and me together, so you might not even know who that other person is but suddenly we three are linked through network analysis.",1

"calling the silk road ""essential"" might seem an exaggeration, but it isn't if you're one of its many regular users. the same goes if you're a regular user of bitcoin—its journey to mainstream acceptance began with the silk road, as it's perfect for anonymous, untraceable transactions (as long as you're careful not to make your identity obvious, of course).",1
"right now, bitcoin is undeniably a mainstream currency, even if it is not necessarily popular in the sense of being used by a significant proportion of society. but it is viewed as a legitimate method of payment, and a legitimate asset, by the people who matter in these issues—cnbc has it as a ticker on its website, for example, and there's a bitcoin hedge fund in malta.",1
"that isn't to say bitcoin doesn't have issues, though. the bitcoin bubble was a fascinating game of musical chairs played out over several months—everyone knew the music would stop, but nobody wanted to guess when that might be while there was easy money to be made. also, ddos attacks have been incredibly effective at manipulating bitcoin's value. closing a large exchange like mt. gox, even if only for a few hours at a time, could cause enough of a price fluctuation for canny hackers to buy low and sell high at their own whim.",1
"businesses have started accepting bitcoin to their credit. there's a whole neighborhood in berlin that's seemingly converted en masse, while the range of online services that accept it—from wordpress to ok cupid—is now long enough to be essentially pointless in listing. this is significant in showing that bitcoin is now a legitimate currency.",1
"we may be entering a new period in how we pay for things online with bitcoin as the first example of theory put into practice. like many new and radical ideas, its implementation has been sketchy and inconsistent. naysayers decry it as a scam or a ponzi scheme. its acolytes proclaim it a crucial weapon in the liberation of the individual from the corporatist banking system and government regulation of commerce.",1
"this argument sees bitcoin being to currencies and online markets what napster was to music piracy. the popularity of bitcoin might well have put the whole system under an immense amount of stress but the underlying concept is an attractive one—a cryptographically secure and anonymous currency that doesn't take a cut from transactions (like, say, amazon's virtual currency) and remains independent of any single, central authority.",1
"for many people, the risks—from fraud, for instance—are outweighed by the benefits. so let's say you're not convinced by bitcoin as it is, but you still like satoshi nakamoto's idea of ""an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third-party."" luckily for you, there are alternatives out there. here are some of the more interesting ones, all forked from the original bitcoin code.",0
"the most prominent alternative to bitcoin, litecoin works upon the same fundamental principles. however, it's positioned not just as an alternative to bitcoin but a complementary cryptocurrency—""the silver to bitcoin's gold.""",1
"apart from the problems with price fluctuation, bitcoin had some fundamental infrastructure issues that weren't anticipated by many of its early adopters. the blockchain—the entire core of the concept—has come under increasing strain as bitcoin has become more popular.",1
"in its simplest terms, the blockchain is the record of every single transaction on the bitcoin network. every transaction is public, and the blockchain continues to grow as it contains the full record of every exchange since bitcoin started.",1
"this has some weird consequences—while it's easy to make yourself anonymous, it's also easy to track those anonymous transactions. this is how sergio lerner worked out that satoshi nakamoto has a fortune of 980,000 bitcoins, worth $113.8 million. if bitcoin owners aren't careful about how they spend that money, it could reveal their identity.",1
"roughly every 10 minutes, a new blockchain is generated and disseminated throughout the bitcoin network by each node, and the version that becomes the accepted, canonical version is the one that is disseminated by the greatest number of nodes. it is, in a way, democratic.",1
"litecoin was founded in october 2011 in recognition that this kind of problem was probably going to happen if bitcoin became popular. merchants require large numbers of small value transactions happening quickly, something that bitcoin isn't really well-suited for. larger transactions, happening more slowly (remember, new blockchains generate every 10 minutes) are more suited to it.",1
"that's why litecoin has a faster transaction time (roughly two and a half minutes) than bitcoin. with four times as many coins in circulation, it theoretically offers smaller divisions of coins to make smaller transaction values more feasible.",1
"it also uses a hashing algorithm—scrypt—which is supposed to keep litecoin mining realistic for desktop users, as opposed to the standard sha256d algorithm used by bitcoin which becomes more time- and power-intensive as time goes on. mining both litecoins and bitcoins at the same time isn't just possible, it's encouraged by litecoin's developers. whether litecoin is more or less secure than bitcoin as a result is a passionate debate within the cryptocurrency community.",1
"while a user has to go to an exchange like vircurex to buy litecoins, mt. gox has announced plans to add support for it in the near future (though when exactly is unclear, thanks to the wave of ddos attacks). being on the largest bitcoin exchange could give litecoin an extra layer of legitimacy through association.",1
"currently, support for the currency is limited to the kinds of places that bitcoin was restricted to in its early days—uselitecoin.com lists casinos and cryptocurrency news sites, with the pirate bay being the most prominent supporter.",1
"the current exchange rate, at time of writing, puts a litecoin worth roughly 1/30th that of a bitcoin (or around $3.28 per litecoin), making it the most valuable cryptocurrency after bitcoin.",1
"for all bitcoin’s problems, the underlying concept is an attractive one: a cryptographically secure and anonymous currency that doesn't take a cut from transactions.",0

"business secretary vince cable said: ""forcing banks to refer businesses to alternative lenders is something i've been determined to make happen. it's good that more smes are making use of alternative finance but the big banks still dominate and small businesses often give up if they're turned down for finance by their bank.",1

"it was this desperate need of cash — against a backdrop of a global pandemic and blocked access to the world economy — that helped foment a rise in crypto adoption in cuba, experts say.",1

"the language doesn't take a vacation, and neither does the dictionary. the words we use are constantly changing in big ways and small, and we're here to record those changes. each word has taken its own path in its own time to become part of our language—to be used frequently enough by some in order to be placed in a reference for all. if you're likely to encounter a word in the wild, whether in the news, a restaurant menu, a tech update, or a twitter meme, that word belongs in the dictionary.",0
"'cryptocurrency' is now in the dictionary, along with 'chiweenie' (a cross between a chihuahua and a dachshund), 'dumpster fire' (a disastrous event), and 'harissa' (a spicy north african chili paste).",1
"there is always something for word lovers when we add entries to the dictionary, but this time there's actually a new word meaning ""word lover"" among them: wordie, patterned after other words denoting enthusiasts such as foodie and groupie. a word used to identify other words is a new tool for linguists, and a demonym names a person who comes from a specific place, like hoosier or parisian. words that come from other places are known as wanderworts-from the german words meaning ""wander"" and ""word."" it refers to a word borrowed from another language, often as a result of trade or the adoption of newly introduced items or cultural practices.",0
"in recent years, the richest source of these newly adopted foreign-language words has been the world of food-or, perhaps we should say: the food of the world. harissa is a spicy north african paste made with chilies, and tzatziki is a greek yogurt sauce made with cucumbers and garlic. from japanese, we now see kabocha, a kind of japanese pumpkin and kombucha, a fermented and effervescent tea drink.",0
"the sometimes perplexing domain of digital financial exchanges opens a window into a subject that requires explanation for many of us, hence the detailed definition of cryptocurrency as well as an entry for initial coin offering, which refers to the first sale of bitcoin-like digital currency. keeping records of financial transactions in a digital database as part of a publicly accessible network uses blockchain technology. and a rare but non-imaginary unicorn is a start-up that is valued at one billion dollars or more.",1

"health care, both physical and psychological, gives us many new words as well. neoadjuvant refers to treatment for a disease or condition that is administered before the primary treatment in order to improve the likelihood of a successful outcome, such as chemotherapy prior to surgery for some cancers. self-care has taken on an increasingly important role in the medical field. a silver alert, modeled on amber alert, informs the public when an elderly person goes missing. among the specific psychological conditions that have been increasingly frequently cited in recent years is narcissistic personality disorder.",0
"new compound terms sometimes show increased specificity that requires a dictionary definition. it was formerly thought that dark chocolate was self-explanatory, but knowing that it is dark in color isn't really sufficient: it's also important to know that it has a high percentage of cocoa and usually no milk and little sugar. case-sensitive is too often encountered in our online world of passwords and codes to ignore. antifa was borrowed from the german abbreviated combination of ""anti-fascist.""",0
"everyday terms that have seen increasing use include life hack and hate-watch. bandwidth is now often used figuratively to mean ""emotional or mental capacity."" our online lives have given us embiggen and subtweet. even more colorful language is on display with dumpster fire, used to mean ""disaster,"" and mansplain, a word that dates back only to 2008 but has quickly shown its utility.",0
"finally, we see the inclusion of an increasing number of interjections and respellings, in part because communication via electronic text increasingly uses approximations of speech, including hmm, ooh, mm-hmm, and, welp, welp. which just goes to show that the dictionary can still be useful for providing meanings even when you're speechless.",0

"those are two of the biggest instances of crypto-fraud. but millions of dollars are scammed from cryptocurrency markets every day in less dramatic ways. coins are suddenly discontinued, with owners taking all the money with them in what the community calls ""rug pulls."" some have investment contracts, ignored like terms-of-service agreements, that prohibit you from taking your money out of a project. other times, entire cryptocurrency exchanges -- which sell coins like a stock exchange sells stocks -- vanish.",1
"""i think i've been scammed over 100 times,"" crypto spider said, adding that he lost $250,000 through fraud in december. ""who knows who creates these projects. a lot of people are taking on pseudonyms, because they're almost all money grabs.""",1

"ironically, it's blockchain, the behind-the-scenes technology, that could be the solution to the burgeoning deepfake problem. in cryptocurrency, the blockchain is an unalterable ledger that tracks every transaction. once it's on the ledger, it can't be altered. that same technology can be used to track anything -- like the creation and distribution of a video, from studio to iphone screen. there are already startups working toward this, like truepic.",1
"when bitcoin hit $40,000 in december, before its tesla-induced all-time-high, it was confirmation to enthusiasts that cryptocurrency is the future. for skeptics, a higher peak just means a more precipitous fall.",1
"""i think they'll become increasingly regulated and less and less interesting,"" gerard said of cryptocurrency. that means less of the ""pretty numbers"" crypto spider was attracted to, but hopefully fewer scams.",1

"bitcoin has many cousins and competitors. none have grown more popular than ethereum, a global computer network with its own virtual currency, called ether.",1
"those rules allow the ethereum network to be programmed to complete certain types of computing tasks, with every computer on the network completing the task in parallel to ensure it is done correctly. generally the tasks involve money.",1
"the creator of ethereum, vitalik buterin, has likened it to a global smartphone that can be programmed to operate according to the apps built on top of it. the apps are called dapps because they are run by a decentralized network of computers.",1
"mr. buterin says he chose the name because it refers to “the hypothetical invisible medium that permeates the universe and allows light to travel.” he announced ethereum in late 2013, but it didn’t go into operation until 2015.",0
"the ethereum network has its own virtual currency, ether. in the simplest sense, ether are needed to pay the other computers on the network to complete tasks. it isn’t free to use the network.",1
"people have also decided to buy and hold ether, betting that it will become more valuable as more people want to use the network and need ether to pay for the network’s computing power.",1
"mr. buterin was a bitcoin aficionado, and he was inspired by its success. but he set out to build something that could do more than bitcoin: he wanted to build a system that would make it possible to program more complex financial transactions.",1
"the shared records of the ethereum network — of every transaction and computation it has ever performed — are known as a blockchain, just as the shared records of all bitcoin transactions are known as a blockchain. but ethereum’s blockchain database is totally independent of bitcoin’s blockchain.",1
"let’s say two companies want to conduct a complicated financial transaction, like settling a stock option. neither company trusts the other company to conduct the transaction on its computers. both companies could hire a third party, like a stock exchange, to conduct the transaction, which is what they generally do today.",1
"but that forces them to trust that third company and to pay that company fees. with ethereum, they can conduct the transaction on a shared computer that allows them both to check the records, ideally saving on fees.",1
"as this example suggests, ethereum has proved attractive to financial companies that have to complete lots of complicated financial transactions with competitors they don’t trust. many banks are looking at how ethereum could be used as a central operating system for various trading markets, replacing today’s exchanges and middlemen. jpmorgan chase has even created its own version of ethereum, known as quorum.",1
"other companies, like samsung and toyota, have experimented with ethereum as a way to keep track of products moving through supply chains that involve many players.",1
dozens of large companies around the world came together this year to create the enterprise ethereum alliance. the group is working to develop versions of the ethereum software that are battle tested enough to be used in a corporate setting.,1
"the versions of the ethereum software that companies are building will most likely be used to set up private networks that would be totally separate from the public ethereum network and that would not use the ether currency. some people, though, are betting that these private networks will eventually be plugged back into the public network.",1
"just as with bitcoin, you can buy ether from people who already own them on virtual currency exchanges. most large countries have exchanges where a variety of virtual currencies can be bought with the local currency.",1
"just as with bitcoin, ethereum are “mined,” or created by computers joined into the ethereum network. these computers are in a race to complete the transactions and computing work on the network. the faster your computers, the more likely you are to win the race and receive a bundle of new ether. there is generally a new winner every 15 seconds or so.",1
"it has not yet been decided how many ether will ultimately be distributed, but the number is likely to be around 100 million. so far, 94 million have been distributed.",1
"as with bitcoin, ethereum mining serves a dual process of getting new ether into the world while providing an incentive for people to join the network and help maintain the ethereum blockchain.",1
"joseph lubin, right, founded consensys, which specializes in applications that run on ethereum. andrew keys, left, is director of enterprise business development at consensys.",1
"even as bitcoin, riven by internal divisions, has struggled, a rival virtual currency — known as ethereum — has soared in value, climbing 1,000 percent over the last three months.",1
"beyond the price spike, ethereum is also attracting attention from giants in finance and technology, like jpmorgan chase, microsoft and ibm, which have described it as a sort of bitcoin 2.0.",1
the rise of the relatively new virtual currency has been helped by a battle within the bitcoin community over how the basic bitcoin software should develop.,1
the fights have slowed down bitcoin transactions and led some people to look for alternative virtual currencies to power their businesses. enter ethereum.,1
"like bitcoin, the ethereum system is built on a blockchain in which every transaction is recorded publicly. the promise of such a system is that it allows the exchange of money and assets more quickly and more cheaply than relying on a long chain of middlemen.",1
"but ethereum has also won fans with its promise to do much more than bitcoin. in addition to the virtual currency, the software provides a way to create online markets and programmable transactions known as smart contracts.",1
"the system is complicated enough that even people who know it well have trouble describing it in plain english. but one application in development would let farmers put their produce up for sale directly to consumers and take payment directly from consumers. there are already dozens of functioning applications built on ethereum, enabling new ways to manage and pay for electricity, sports bets and even ponzi schemes.",1
"all of this work is still very early. the first full public version of the ethereum software was recently released, and the system could face some of the same technical and legal problems that have tarnished bitcoin.",1
"many bitcoin advocates say ethereum will face more security problems than bitcoin because of the greater complexity of the software. thus far, ethereum has faced much less testing, and many fewer attacks, than bitcoin. the novel design of ethereum may also invite intense scrutiny by authorities given that potentially fraudulent contracts, like the ponzi schemes, can be written directly into the ethereum system.",1
but the sophisticated capabilities of the system have made it fascinating to some executives in corporate america. ibm said last year that it was experimenting with ethereum as a way to control real world objects in the so-called internet of things.,0
"“ethereum is a general platform where you can solve problems in many industries using a fairly elegant solution — the most elegant solution we have seen to date,” said marley gray, a director of business development and strategy at microsoft.",0
"mr. gray is responsible for microsoft’s work with blockchains, the database concept that bitcoin introduced. blockchains are designed to store transactions and data without requiring any central authority or repository.",1
blockchain ledgers are generally maintained and updated by networks of computers working together — somewhat similar to the way that wikipedia is updated and maintained by all its users.,1
"many corporations, though, have created their own ethereum networks with private blockchains, independent of the public system, and that could ultimately detract from the value of the individual unit in the ethereum system — known as an ether — that people have recently been buying.",1
"the interest in ethereum is one sign of the corporate fascination with blockchains. most major banks have expressed an interest in using them to make trading and money transfer faster and more efficient. on tuesday, executives from the largest banks will gather for a conference, “blockchain: tapping into the real potential, cutting through the hype.”",0
"many of these banks have recently been looking at how some version of ethereum might be put to use. jpmorgan, for instance, has created a specific tool, masala, that allows some of its internal databases to interact with an ethereum blockchain.",1
"michael novogratz, a former top executive at the private equity firm fortress investing group, who helped lead fortress’s investment in bitcoin, has been looking at ethereum since he left fortress last fall. mr. novogratz said that he made a “significant” purchase of ether in january. he has also heard how the financial industry’s chatter about the virtual currency has evolved.",1
"“a lot of the more established players were thinking, ‘it’s still an experiment,’ ” he said. “it feels like in the last two to three months that experiment is at least getting a lot more validation.”",0
"since the beginning of the year, the value of an individual unit of ether has soared as high as $12 from around $1. that has brought the value of all existing ether to over $1 billion at times, significantly more than any virtual currency other than bitcoin, which had over $6 billion in value outstanding last week.",1
"since bitcoin was invented, there have been many so-called alt-coins that have tried to improve on bitcoin, but none have won the following of ethereum.",1
"unlike bitcoin, which was released in 2009 by a mysterious creator known as satoshi nakamoto, ethereum was created in a more transparent fashion by a 21-year-old russian-canadian, vitalik buterin, after he dropped out of waterloo university in ontario.",1
"the most basic aim of ethereum was to make it possible to program binding agreements into the blockchain — the smart contract concept. two people, for instance, could program a bet on a sports game directly into the ethereum blockchain. once the final score came in from a mutually agreed upon source — say, the associated press — the money would be automatically transferred to the winning party. ether can be used as a currency in this system, but ether are also necessary to pay for the network power needed to process the bet.",1
the ethereum system has sometimes been described as a single shared computer that is run by the network of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by ether.,1
"a team of seven co-founders helped mr. buterin write up the software after he released the initial description of the system. mr. buterin’s team raised $18 million in 2014 through a presale of ether, which helped fund the ethereum foundation, which supports the software’s development.",1
"like bitcoin, ethereum has succeeded by attracting a dedicated network of followers who have helped support the software, partly in the hope that their ether will increase in value if the system succeeds. last week, there were 5,800 computers — or nodes — helping support the network around the world. the bitcoin network had about 7,400 nodes.",1
"one of mr. buterin’s co-founders, joseph lubin, has set up consensys, a company based in brooklyn that has hired over 50 developers to build applications on the ethereum system, including one that enables music distribution and another that allows for a new kind of financial auditing.",1
"the consensys offices are in an old industrial building in the bushwick section of brooklyn. the office is essentially one large room, with all the messy trademarks of a start-up operation, including white boards on the walls and computer parts lying around.",0
"mr. lubin said he had thrown himself into ethereum after starting to think that it delivered on some of the failed promise of bitcoin, especially when it came to allowing new kinds of online contracts and markets.",1
"joseph bonneau, a computer science researcher at stanford who studies so-called crypto-currencies, said ethereum was the first system that had really caught his interest since bitcoin.",1
"“bitcoin is still probably the safest bet, but ethereum is certainly no. 2, and some folks will say it is more likely to be around in 10 years,” mr. bonneau said. “it will depend if any real markets develop around it. if there is some actual application.”",1

"crypto-collateralized stablecoins are backed by other cryptocurrencies. because the reserve cryptocurrency may also be prone to high volatility, such stablecoins are overcollateralized—that is, the value of cryptocurrency held in reserves exceeds the value of the stablecoins issued.",1
"algorithmic stablecoins may or may not hold reserve assets. their primary distinction is the strategy of keeping the stablecoin's value stable by controlling its supply through an algorithm, essentially a computer program running a preset formula.",1
"in some ways that's not so different from central banks, which also don't rely on a reserve asset to keep the value of the currency they issue stable. the difference is that a central bank like the u.s. federal reserve sets monetary policy publicly based on well-understood parameters, and its status as the issuer of legal tender does wonders for the credibility of that policy.",1

"like all stablecoins, tether is intended to only ever trade at a fixed value relative to a conventional currency: one tether token is always supposed to be $1.",1
"a stablecoin, like the name suggests, is a type of cryptocurrency that is supposed to have a stable value, such as us$1 per token. how they achieve that varies: the largest, such as tether and usd coin, are effectively banks. they hold large reserves in cash, liquid assets, and other investments, and simply use those reserves to maintain a stable price.",1

"it has been hit with the general slump in the tech sector, blowback from the crypto collapse and problems of its own. the company prompted panic among its users with a legally mandated disclosure that, if it goes bankrupt, customer deposits are not protected in the same way bank deposits are.",1
"there are particular concerns about tether because of its foundational role in the financial engineering of much of the sector and the fact it holds reserves in other cryptocurrencies, leading to fears of contagion if it collapses.",1
"unlike terra – which maintains its value via a complex algorithm – tether pledges that all its tokens “are backed 100%” by its reserves, which were $80bn in its last report in december and also include loans, precious metals, and investments in other crypto sector companies.",1
"in theory tether should never trade below $1: any time it does, there is guaranteed profit from commercial arbitrageurs willing to buy the token at a discount and return it to tether, which pledges to buy it from them at full value.",1
"however, since terra’s collapse there has been such a rush of selling across the entire sector that the market value of tether fell as low as 95¢ before recovering. public records show at least one large redemption removed almost $350m from the reserves.",1
"as redemptions increase, the company could be forced to call in its loans to other crypto companies, in turn causing them to suffer financially. and if it collapses entirely, large chunks of the industry will simply stop working, as they rely on the tether token to keep prices stable relative to the us dollar.",1
"in a statement, the tether company said it was “business as usual amid some expected market panic” and that it had processed $2bn of withdrawals. that represents about half of the company’s cash on hand.",1

"when the honduran police came to evict her in 2009 mariana catalina izaguirre had lived in her lowly house for three decades. unlike many of her neighbours in tegucigalpa, the country’s capital, she even had an official title to the land on which it stood. but the records at the country’s property institute showed another person registered as its owner, too—and that person convinced a judge to sign an eviction order. by the time the legal confusion was finally sorted out, ms izaguirre’s house had been demolished.",1
"such problems seem worlds away from bitcoin, a currency based on clever cryptography which has a devoted following among mostly well-off, often anti-government and sometimes criminal geeks. but the cryptographic technology that underlies bitcoin, called the “blockchain”, has applications well beyond cash and currency. it offers a way for people who do not know or trust each other to create a record of who owns what that will compel the assent of everyone concerned. it is a way of making and preserving truths.",1
"that is why politicians seeking to clean up the property institute in honduras have asked factom, an american startup, to provide a prototype of a blockchain-based land registry. interest in the idea has also been expressed in greece, which has no proper land registry and where only 7% of the territory is adequately mapped.",1
"other applications for blockchain and similar “distributed ledgers” range from thwarting diamond thieves to streamlining stockmarkets: the nasdaq exchange will soon start using a blockchain-based system to record trades in privately held companies. the bank of england, not known for technological flights of fancy, seems electrified: distributed ledgers, it concluded in a research note late last year, are a “significant innovation” that could have “far-reaching implications” in the financial industry.",0
"the politically minded see the blockchain reaching further than that. when co-operatives and left-wingers gathered for this year’s ouishare fest in paris to discuss ways that grass-roots organisations could undermine giant repositories of data like facebook, the blockchain made it into almost every speech. libertarians dream of a world where more and more state regulations are replaced with private contracts between individuals—contracts which blockchain-based programming would make self-enforcing.",0
"the blockchain began life in the mind of satoshi nakamoto, the brilliant, pseudonymous and so far unidentified creator of bitcoin—a “purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash”, as he put it in a paper published in 2008. to work as cash, bitcoin had to be able to change hands without being diverted into the wrong account and to be incapable of being spent twice by the same person. to fulfil mr nakamoto’s dream of a decentralised system the avoidance of such abuses had to be achieved without recourse to any trusted third party, such as the banks which stand behind conventional payment systems.",1
"let us say that alice wants to pay bob for services rendered. both have bitcoin “wallets”—software which accesses the blockchain rather as a browser accesses the web, but does not identify the user to the system. the transaction starts with alice’s wallet proposing that the blockchain be changed so as to show alice’s wallet a little emptier and bob’s a little fuller.",1
"the network goes through a number of steps to confirm this change. as the proposal propagates over the network the various nodes check, by inspecting the ledger, whether alice actually has the bitcoin she now wants to spend. if everything looks kosher, specialised nodes called miners will bundle alice’s proposal with other similarly reputable transactions to create a new block for the blockchain.",1
"this entails repeatedly feeding the data through a cryptographic “hash” function which boils the block down into a string of digits of a given length (see diagram). like a lot of cryptography, this hashing is a one-way street. it is easy to go from the data to their hash; impossible to go from the hash back to the data. but though the hash does not contain the data, it is still unique to them. change what goes into the block in any way—alter a transaction by a single digit—and the hash would be different.",1
"that hash is put, along with some other data, into the header of the proposed block. this header then becomes the basis for an exacting mathematical puzzle which involves using the hash function yet again. this puzzle can only be solved by trial and error. across the network, miners grind through trillions and trillions of possibilities looking for the answer. when a miner finally comes up with a solution other nodes quickly check it (that’s the one-way street again: solving is hard but checking is easy), and each node that confirms the solution updates the blockchain accordingly. the hash of the header becomes the new block’s identifying string, and that block is now part of the ledger. alice’s payment to bob, and all the other transactions the block contains, are confirmed.",1
"this puzzle stage introduces three things that add hugely to bitcoin’s security. one is chance. you cannot predict which miner will solve a puzzle, and so you cannot predict who will get to update the blockchain at any given time, except in so far as it has to be one of the hard working miners, not some random interloper. this makes cheating hard.",1
"the second addition is history. each new header contains a hash of the previous block’s header, which in turn contains a hash of the header before that, and so on and so on all the way back to the beginning. it is this concatenation that makes the blocks into a chain. starting from all the data in the ledger it is trivial to reproduce the header for the latest block. make a change anywhere, though—even back in one of the earliest blocks—and that changed block’s header will come out different. this means that so will the next block’s, and all the subsequent ones. the ledger will no longer match the latest block’s identifier, and will be rejected.",0
"is there a way round this? imagine that alice changes her mind about paying bob and tries to rewrite history so that her bitcoin stays in her wallet. if she were a competent miner she could solve the requisite puzzle and produce a new version of the blockchain. but in the time it took her to do so, the rest of the network would have lengthened the original blockchain. and nodes always work on the longest version of the blockchain there is. this rule stops the occasions when two miners find the solution almost simultaneously from causing anything more than a temporary fork in the chain. it also stops cheating. to force the system to accept her new version alice would need to lengthen it faster than the rest of the system was lengthening the original. short of controlling more than half the computers—known in the jargon as a “51% attack”—that should not be possible.",0
"leaving aside the difficulties of trying to subvert the network, there is a deeper question: why bother to be part of it at all? because the third thing the puzzle-solving step adds is an incentive. forging a new block creates new bitcoin. the winning miner earns 25 bitcoin, worth about $7,500 at current prices.",0
"most of the data in the blockchain are about bitcoin. but they do not have to be. mr nakamoto has built what geeks call an “open platform”—a distributed system the workings of which are open to examination and elaboration. the paragon of such platforms is the internet itself; other examples include operating systems like android or windows. applications that depend on basic features of the blockchain can thus be developed without asking anybody for permission or paying anyone for the privilege. “the internet finally has a public data base,” says chris dixon of andreessen horowitz, a venture-capital firm which has financed several bitcoin start-ups, including coinbase, which provides wallets, and 21, which makes bitcoin-mining hardware for the masses.",0
"for now blockchain-based offerings fall in three buckets. the first takes advantage of the fact that any type of asset can be transferred using the blockchain. one of the startups betting on this idea is colu. it has developed a mechanism to “dye” very small bitcoin transactions (called “bitcoin dust”) by adding extra data to them so that they can represent bonds, shares or units of precious metals.",0
it is the third bucket that contains the most ambitious applications: “smart contracts” that execute themselves automatically under the right circumstances. bitcoin can be “programmed” so that it only becomes available under certain conditions. one use of this ability is to defer the payment miners get for solving a puzzle until 99 more blocks have been added—which provides another incentive to keep the blockchain in good shape.,1
"lighthouse, a project started by mike hearn, one of bitcoin’s leading programmers, is a decentralised crowdfunding service that uses these principles. if enough money is pledged to a project it all goes through; if the target is never reached, none does. mr hearn says his scheme will both be cheaper than non-bitcoin competitors and also more independent, as governments will be unable to pull the plug on a project they don’t like.",1
"though mr nakamoto’s subtle design has so far proved impregnable, academic researchers have identified tactics that might allow a sneaky and well financed miner to compromise the block chain without direct control of 51% of it. and getting control of an appreciable fraction of the network’s resources looks less unlikely than it used to. once the purview of hobbyists, bitcoin mining is now dominated by large “pools”, in which small miners share their efforts and rewards, and the operators of big data centres, many based in areas of china, such as inner mongolia, where electricity is cheap.",1
"another worry is the impact on the environment. with no other way to establish the bona fides of miners, the bitcoin architecture forces them to do a lot of hard computing; this “proof of work”, without which there can be no reward, insures that all concerned have skin in the game. but it adds up to a lot of otherwise pointless computing. according to blockchain.info the network’s miners are now trying 450 thousand trillion solutions per second. and every calculation takes energy.",1
"because miners keep details of their hardware secret, nobody really knows how much power the network consumes. if everyone were using the most efficient hardware, its annual electricity usage might be about two terawatt-hours—a bit more than the amount used by the 150,000 inhabitants of king’s county in california’s central valley. make really pessimistic assumptions about the miners’ efficiency, though, and you can get the figure up to 40 terawatt-hours, almost two-thirds of what the 10m people in los angeles county get through. that surely overstates the problem; still, the more widely people use bitcoin, the worse the waste could get.",1
"yet for all this profligacy bitcoin remains limited. because mr nakamoto decided to cap the size of a block at one megabyte, or about 1,400 transactions, it can handle only around seven transactions per second, compared to the 1,736 a second visa handles in america. blocks could be made bigger; but bigger blocks would take longer to propagate through the network, worsening the risks of forking.",1
"earlier platforms have surmounted similar problems. when millions went online after the invention of the web browser in the 1990s pundits predicted the internet would grind to a standstill: eppur si muove. similarly, the bitcoin system is not standing still. specialised mining computers can be very energy efficient, and less energy-hungry alternatives to the proof-of-work mechanism have been proposed. developers are also working on an add-on called “lightning” which would handle large numbers of smaller transactions outside the blockchain. faster connections will let bigger blocks propagate as quickly as small ones used to.",0
"the problem is not so much a lack of fixes. it is that the network’s “bitcoin improvement process” makes it hard to choose one. change requires community-wide agreement, and these are not people to whom consensus comes easily. consider the civil war being waged over the size of blocks. one camp frets that quickly increasing the block size will lead to further concentration in the mining industry and turn bitcoin into more of a conventional payment processor. the other side argues that the system could crash as early as next year if nothing is done, with transactions taking hours.",1
"mr hearn and gavin andresen, another bitcoin grandee, are leaders of the big-block camp. they have called on mining firms to install a new version of bitcoin which supports a much bigger block size. some miners who do, though, appear to be suffering cyber-attacks. and in what seems a concerted effort to show the need for, or the dangers of, such an upgrade, the system is being driven to its limits by vast numbers of tiny transactions.",1
"this has all given new momentum to efforts to build an alternative to the bitcoin blockchain, one that might be optimised for the storing of distributed ledgers rather than for the running of a cryptocurrency. multichain, a build-your-own-blockchain platform offered by coin sciences, another startup, demonstrates what is possible. as well as offering the wherewithal to build a public blockchain like bitcoin’s, it can also be used to build private chains open only to vetted users. if all the users start off trusted the need for mining and proof-of-work is reduced or eliminated, and a currency attached to the ledger becomes an optional extra.",0
"the first industry to adopt such sons of blockchain may well be the one whose failings originally inspired mr nakamoto: finance. in recent months there has been a rush of bankerly enthusiasm for private blockchains as a way of keeping tamper-proof ledgers. one of the reasons, irony of ironies, is that this technology born of anti-government libertarianism could make it easier for the banks to comply with regulatory requirements on knowing their customers and anti-money-laundering rules. but there is a deeper appeal.",1
"industrial historians point out that new powers often become available long before the processes that best use them are developed. when electric motors were first developed they were deployed like the big hulking steam engines that came before them. it took decades for manufacturers to see that lots of decentralised electric motors could reorganise every aspect of the way they made things. in its report on digital currencies, the bank of england sees something similar afoot in the financial sector. thanks to cheap computing financial firms have digitised their inner workings; but they have not yet changed their organisations to match. payment systems are mostly still centralised: transfers are cleared through the central bank. when financial firms do business with each other, the hard work of synchronising their internal ledgers can take several days, which ties up capital and increases risk.",1
"distributed ledgers that settle transactions in minutes or seconds could go a long way to solving such problems and fulfilling the greater promise of digitised banking. they could also save banks a lot of money: according to santander, a bank, by 2022 such ledgers could cut the industry’s bills by up to $20 billion a year. vendors still need to prove that they could deal with the far-higher-than-bitcoin transaction rates that would be involved; but big banks are already pushing for standards to shape the emerging technology. one of them, ubs, has proposed the creation of a standard “settlement coin”. the first order of business for r3 cev, a blockchain startup in which ubs has invested alongside goldman sachs, jpmorgan and 22 other banks, is to develop a standardised architecture for private ledgers.",1
"the banks’ problems are not unique. all sorts of companies and public bodies suffer from hard-to-maintain and often incompatible databases and the high transaction costs of getting them to talk to each other. this is the problem ethereum, arguably the most ambitious distributed-ledger project, wants to solve. the brainchild of vitalik buterin, a 21-year-old canadian programming prodigy, ethereum’s distributed ledger can deal with more data than bitcoin’s can. and it comes with a programming language that allows users to write more sophisticated smart contracts, thus creating invoices that pay themselves when a shipment arrives or share certificates which automatically send their owners dividends if profits reach a certain level. such cleverness, mr buterin hopes, will allow the formation of “decentralised autonomous organisations”—virtual companies that are basically just sets of rules running on ethereum’s blockchain.",0
"one of the areas where such ideas could have radical effects is in the “internet of things”—a network of billions of previously mute everyday objects such as fridges, doorstops and lawn sprinklers. a recent report from ibm entitled “device democracy” argues that it would be impossible to keep track of and manage these billions of devices centrally, and unwise to to try; such attempts would make them vulnerable to hacking attacks and government surveillance. distributed registers seem a good alternative.",0
"the sort of programmability ethereum offers does not just allow people’s property to be tracked and registered. it allows it to be used in new sorts of ways. thus a car-key embedded in the ethereum blockchain could be sold or rented out in all manner of rule-based ways, enabling new peer-to-peer schemes for renting or sharing cars. further out, some talk of using the technology to make by-then-self-driving cars self-owning, to boot. such vehicles could stash away some of the digital money they make from renting out their keys to pay for fuel, repairs and parking spaces, all according to preprogrammed rules.",1
"unsurprisingly, some think such schemes overly ambitious. ethereum’s first (“genesis”) block was only mined in august and, though there is a little ecosystem of start-ups clustered around it, mr buterin admitted in a recent blog post that it is somewhat short of cash. but the details of which particular blockchains end up flourishing matter much less than the broad enthusiasm for distributed ledgers that is leading both start-ups and giant incumbents to examine their potential. despite society’s inexhaustible ability to laugh at accountants, the workings of ledgers really do matter.",0
"today’s world is deeply dependent on double-entry book-keeping. its standardised system of recording debits and credits is central to any attempt to understand a company’s financial position. whether modern capitalism absolutely required such book-keeping in order to develop, as werner sombart, a german sociologist, claimed in the early 20th century, is open to question. though the system began among the merchants of renaissance italy, which offers an interesting coincidence of timing, it spread round the world much more slowly than capitalism did, becoming widely used only in the late 19th century. but there is no question that the technique is of fundamental importance not just as a record of what a company does, but as a way of defining what one can be.",0
"ledgers that no longer need to be maintained by a company—or a government—may in time spur new changes in how companies and governments work, in what is expected of them and in what can be done without them. a realisation that systems without centralised record-keeping can be just as trustworthy as those that have them may bring radical change.",0
"such ideas can expect some eye-rolling—blockchains are still a novelty applicable only in a few niches, and the doubts as to how far they can spread and scale up may prove well founded. they can also expect resistance. some of bitcoin’s critics have always seen it as the latest techy attempt to spread a “californian ideology” which promises salvation through technology-induced decentralisation while ignoring and obfuscating the realities of power—and happily concentrating vast wealth in the hands of an elite. the idea of making trust a matter of coding, rather than of democratic politics, legitimacy and accountability, is not necessarily an appealing or empowering one.",0
"at the same time, a world with record-keeping mathematically immune to manipulation would have many benefits. evicted ms izaguirre would be better off; so would many others in many other settings. if blockchains have a fundamental paradox, it is this: by offering a way of setting the past and present in cryptographic stone, they could make the future a very different place.",1
"published since september 1843 to take part in “a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.”",0
"all this cleverness does not, in itself, make bitcoin a particularly attractive currency. its value is unstable and unpredictable (see chart), and the total amount in circulation is deliberately limited. but the blockchain mechanism works very well. according to blockchain.info, a website that tracks such things, on an average day more than 120,000 transactions are added to the blockchain, representing about $75m exchanged. there are now 380,000 blocks; the ledger weighs in at nearly 45 gigabytes.",0
"the advent of distributed ledgers opens up an “entirely new quadrant of possibilities”, in the words of albert wenger of usv, a new york venture firm that has invested in startups such as openbazaar, a middleman-free peer-to-peer marketplace. but for all that the blockchain is open and exciting, sceptics argue that its security may yet be fallible and its procedures may not scale. what works for bitcoin and a few niche applications may be unable to support thousands of different services with millions of users.",0

i recently had a fascinating chat with the economist peter šurda to discuss how nonpolitical cryptocurrencies like bitcoin could alter the future of fractional reserve banking.,1
"peter is also a software developer experienced in the online payments industry and will present at the bitcoin 2013: the future of payments conference in san jose in may. his 2012 master's thesis at vienna university of economics and business was entitled economics of bitcoin: is bitcoin an alternative to fiat currencies and gold? he's an abstract thinker, but the implications of his work are tantalizing: that digital money like bitcoin opens up possibilities for banking without central planners or a lender of last resort, where interest rates and reserve requirements are driven purely by the market.",1
"the debate between the full reserve bankers and the fractional reserve bankers is an old one and it has been explored in depth by the austrian school of economics. more recently, the debate has been broadened to include the dynamics of introducing the bitcoin cryptocurrency, which is the functional equivalent of digital gold, since its supply is predictable and fixed. (there are currently 10.9 million bitcoins in circulation with a total fixed supply of 21 million expected to be mined before 2140, 99% of them by the year 2032.) the austrian school economist michael suede and the technologist eli gothill have speculated that fractional reserve banking can indeed appear within a bitcoin monetary environment. this is where we join up with peter.",1
"jon matonis: i enjoyed your blog post, ""market forces and fractional reserve banking."" do you consider fractional reserve banking to be compatible with austrian economics?",1
"peter šurda: first of all, i would like to separate fractional reserve banking and credit expansion. on one hand, there are ways of increasing the money supply, in the broader sense, which do not require fractional reserve banking or changes in the monetary base such as a system based on the principle of mutual credit like lets [local exchange trading systems], or a fiat currency that uses bitcoin as reserves (i.e. they are not claims in the sense that ludwig von mises uses them, but they act as full substitutes). from the opposite direction, fractional reserve banking does not necessarily lead to credit expansion.",1
"so i think that the economic and legal analysis are two separate issues and need to be addressed separately. i avoided the legal analysis in my thesis and concentrated on austrian business cycle theory and policy issues, but in an earlier draft i have several pages about legal aspects too, and i discussed the topic with [the legal theorist] stephan kinsella.",0
"peter šurda: austrians have made arguments in the past that lead to the conclusion that fractional reserve banking does not necessarily lead to credit expansion, even though they never explicitly formulated it this way and might not have realized the connection. the reason is that if credit instruments do not decrease transaction costs over the monetary base, they are unlikely to act as a part of the money supply. bitcoin shows that this is not only a hypothetical but empirically possible to implement. with bitcoin, it is much less likely that credit expansion will occur.",0
"in other words, we need to separate two things. why do people want to hold fractional reserve banking instruments, which may include the interest payments as one of the reasons, and why do people want to use fractional reserve banking instruments as a medium of exchange which, i argue, requires that the fractional reserve banking instruments decrease transaction costs. that they historically manifested themselves through a common instrument is an empirical quirk and not an economic rule. the ability to loan money is beneficial. contrary to many austrians, i agree that maturity transformation can be beneficial, and if the loan ends up being a liquid instrument, it also can be beneficial. but if it is so liquid that it becomes a part of the money supply, that's when it has a detrimental effect on the economy.",1
"for full reservists, bitcoin shows that the question of fractional reserve banking is less important than they thought. fractional reservists, on the other hand, need to think about the nature of the mechanisms equilibrating the money supply. i tried to explain the issue to [the economists] george selgin and david glasner in comments on their websites, but i wasn't successful in getting my point through.",1
"jon matonis: if bitcoin is digital gold, does that portend a future where a bitcoin standard (akin to the gold standard) can emerge or partial bitcoin backing for other currencies?",0
"peter šurda: they probably can emerge, but the more important question is whether they would be preferred to bitcoin. only something that provides a significant improvement would be preferred. i only know two potential candidates for that: ripple and opentransactions.",0
"jon matonis: in a bitcoin world, is fractional reserve banking only possible with offline substitutes (such as physical coins or cards, which can be traded hand-to-hand, containing the private key to a bitcoin address) or an intentional ""fork"" in the block chain ledger?",1
"peter šurda: hypothetically, the reserves can be offline and the substitute can be a clearing system like ripple, so there are other possibilities too. but if i understand your point correctly, offline ""substitutes"" might have a higher chance of actually becoming full substitutes because they might have more obvious advantages.",0
"jon matonis: as the recent block chain fork episode demonstrates, there is a need for offline bitcoin transactions to continue. is this demand sufficient for a money substitute to evolve, such as offline substitutes with full or partial bitcoin backing?",0
"peter šurda: this is primarily an empirical question, so we can't be completely sure about that. i think the probability for this is significantly lower than with the currencies that we've known historically. the end result is also path-dependent; for instance, it depends on how quickly bitcoin matures and/or adapts to changes compared to the potential substitute.",1
"fractional reserve banking does not come into existence magically. it must follow economic rules. with gold and similar commodities, fractional reserve banking comes into existence for these reasons: on the demand side, there is a demand for money substitutes, because they provide something that money proper does not; and on the supply side, money substitutes carry maintenance costs for the issuer (e.g. storage of gold) and these need to be offset somehow. the issuer can charge on holding (e.g. demurrage of bank notes), transacting (e.g. check clearing), or, obviously, externalize the costs through fractional reserves. from the point of view of an individual user, fractional reserve banking appears to be the least costly alternative. so obviously fractional reserve banking wins.",1
"putting it together: if there is a general demand for money substitutes, this leads to fractional reserve banking. unless it's illegal. then it might not. solution: have money which does not lead to the creation of money substitutes. bitcoin shows that at least hypothetically, this is possible. i might even go a bit further and make this statement: if on a free market money substitutes do not develop even though there is no legal or technical obstacle for them, it means that the choice of money is pareto-optimal since no change in the monetary system leads to an increase in utility.",1
jon matonis: does a demand for positive return on bitcoin balances lead to an environment of competitive bank lending with risk-adjusted interest rates? and will this lead to an environment of fractional reserve banking with depositors offered higher interest rates in exchange for the additional risk premium of running a fractional portfolio?,1
"peter šurda: yes, i would say it does, but until there are industry niches that primarily use bitcoin, it is probably not much different from gambling.",1
"this might lead to negotiable credit instruments with maturity-mismatching or maturity transformation, depending on which economic school you use for terminology. however, i don't think this feature alone is sufficient for these instruments to be accepted as full substitutes whereas george selgin appears to think it is. now, whether to call such a situation ""fractional reserve banking"" even though no credit expansion occurs is unclear. i lean towards yes, but there could be other interpretations.",0
"peter šurda: using bitcoin for loans only makes sense for those businesses that use bitcoin as a unit of account, unless, of course, you're just speculating on the market but don't actually sell any goods or services. i think this will only occur at much higher levels of liquidity or until we can be quite sure that it deserves the label ""money."" until these higher levels of liquidity are reached, the price of bitcoin will probably be quite volatile, which reduces the likelihood that people use it as a unit of account.",1
"however, there could be niche market segments that use bitcoin as a primary medium of exchange and [bitcoin] mining is the most obvious candidate. for these, the unit of account function would make sense even if the global market penetration is lower.",1
"assuming one of these thresholds is crossed and the money supply remains inelastic (i.e. no significant credit expansion), the interest rate of bitcoin should be a good reflection of the time preference of those market participants that use it as a unit of account. bitcoin also makes it much easier for lending to occur in a decentralized manner, i think. rather than a small number of ""too big to fail"" institutions, we should see smaller specialized teams that act as facilitators without owning the liabilities or being liable themselves.",1
jon matonis: can a free market fractional reserve system (as opposed to a central banking fractional reserve system) coexist with full reserve banking? or will one drive out the other?,1
"peter šurda: i think that if money substitutes emerge, fractional reserve banking will out-compete 100% reserve banking in the market. i deal with this a bit in an earlier draft of the thesis. if they don't emerge, on the other hand, we'll have a money supply equivalent to the monetary base and debt will not cause changes in the money supply. it would be viewed as merely highly liquid credit. i don't think they can coexist for a long time assuming the same underlying money in the narrower sense, of course.",1

"one key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is how the data is structured. a blockchain collects information together in groups, known as blocks, that hold sets of information. blocks have certain storage capacities and, when filled, are closed and linked to the previously filled block, forming a chain of data known as the blockchain. all new information that follows that freshly added block is compiled into a newly formed block that will then also be added to the chain once filled.",0
"the goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. in this way, a blockchain is the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions that cannot be altered, deleted, or destroyed. this is why blockchains are also known as a distributed ledger technology (dlt).",0
"imagine that a company owns a server farm with 10,000 computers used to maintain a database holding all of its client’s account information. this company owns a warehouse building that contains all of these computers under one roof and has full control of each of these computers and all of the information contained within them. this, however, provides a single point of failure. what happens if the electricity at that location goes out? what if its internet connection is severed? what if it burns to the ground? what if a bad actor erases everything with a single keystroke? in any case, the data is lost or corrupted.",0
"what a blockchain does is to allow the data held in that database to be spread out among several network nodes at various locations. this not only creates redundancy but also maintains the fidelity of the data stored therein—if somebody tries to alter a record at one instance of the database, the other nodes would not be altered and thus would prevent a bad actor from doing so. if one user tampers with bitcoin’s record of transactions, all other nodes would cross-reference each other and easily pinpoint the node with the incorrect information. this system helps to establish an exact and transparent order of events. this way, no single node within the network can alter information held within it.",1
"because of this, the information and history (such as of transactions of a cryptocurrency) are irreversible. such a record could be a list of transactions (such as with a cryptocurrency), but it also is possible for a blockchain to hold a variety of other information like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company’s product inventory.",1
"because of the decentralized nature of bitcoin’s blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by either having a personal node or using blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. each node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. this means that if you wanted to, you could track bitcoin wherever it goes.",1
"for example, exchanges have been hacked in the past, where those who kept bitcoin on the exchange lost everything. while the hacker may be entirely anonymous, the bitcoins that they extracted are easily traceable. if the bitcoins stolen in some of these hacks were to be moved or spent somewhere, it would be known.",1
"of course, the records stored in the bitcoin blockchain (as well as most others) are encrypted. this means that only the owner of a record can decrypt it to reveal their identity (using a public-private key pair). as a result, users of blockchains can remain anonymous while preserving transparency.",1
"blockchain technology achieves decentralized security and trust in several ways. to begin with, new blocks are always stored linearly and chronologically. that is, they are always added to the “end” of the blockchain. after a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, it is extremely difficult to go back and alter the contents of the block unless a majority of the network has reached a consensus to do so. that’s because each block contains its own hash, along with the hash of the block before it, as well as the previously mentioned timestamp. hash codes are created by a mathematical function that turns digital information into a string of numbers and letters. if that information is edited in any way, then the hash code changes as well.",1
"let’s say that a hacker, who also runs a node on a blockchain network, wants to alter a blockchain and steal cryptocurrency from everyone else. if they were to alter their own single copy, it would no longer align with everyone else’s copy. when everyone else cross-references their copies against each other, they would see this one copy stand out, and that hacker’s version of the chain would be cast away as illegitimate.",1
"succeeding with such a hack would require that the hacker simultaneously control and alter 51% or more of the copies of the blockchain so that their new copy becomes the majority copy and, thus, the agreed-upon chain. such an attack would also require an immense amount of money and resources, as they would need to redo all of the blocks because they would now have different timestamps and hash codes.",1
"due to the size of many cryptocurrency networks and how fast they are growing, the cost to pull off such a feat probably would be insurmountable. this would be not only extremely expensive but also likely fruitless. doing such a thing would not go unnoticed, as network members would see such drastic alterations to the blockchain. the network members would then hard fork off to a new version of the chain that has not been affected. this would cause the attacked version of the token to plummet in value, making the attack ultimately pointless, as the bad actor has control of a worthless asset. the same would occur if the bad actor were to attack the new fork of bitcoin. it is built this way so that taking part in the network is far more economically incentivized than attacking it.",1
"the key thing to understand here is that bitcoin merely uses blockchain as a means to transparently record a ledger of payments, but blockchain can, in theory, be used to immutably record any number of data points. as discussed above, this could be in the form of transactions, votes in an election, product inventories, state identifications, deeds to homes, and much more.",1
"currently, tens of thousands of projects are looking to implement blockchains in a variety of ways to help society other than just recording transactions—for example, as a way to vote securely in democratic elections. the nature of blockchain’s immutability means that fraudulent voting would become far more difficult to occur. for example, a voting system could work such that each citizen of a country would be issued a single cryptocurrency or token. each candidate would then be given a specific wallet address, and the voters would send their token or crypto to the address of whichever candidate for whom they wish to vote. the transparent and traceable nature of blockchain would eliminate both the need for human vote counting and the ability of bad actors to tamper with physical ballots.",1
"blockchains have been heralded as being a disruptive force to the finance sector, and especially with the functions of payments and banking. however, banks and decentralized blockchains are vastly different.",1
"as we now know, blocks on bitcoin’s blockchain store data about monetary transactions. today, there are more than 10,000 other cryptocurrency systems running on blockchain. but it turns out that blockchain is actually a reliable way of storing data about other types of transactions as well.",1
"perhaps no industry stands to benefit from integrating blockchain into its business operations more than banking. financial institutions only operate during business hours, usually five days a week. that means if you try to deposit a check on friday at 6 p.m., you will likely have to wait until monday morning to see that money hit your account. even if you do make your deposit during business hours, the transaction can still take one to three days to verify due to the sheer volume of transactions that banks need to settle. blockchain, on the other hand, never sleeps.",1
"by integrating blockchain into banks, consumers can see their transactions processed in as little as 10 minutes—basically the time it takes to add a block to the blockchain, regardless of holidays or the time of day or week. with blockchain, banks also have the opportunity to exchange funds between institutions more quickly and securely. in the stock trading business, for example, the settlement and clearing process can take up to three days (or longer, if trading internationally), meaning that the money and shares are frozen for that period of time.",1
"blockchain forms the bedrock for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. the u.s. dollar is controlled by the federal reserve. under this central authority system, a user’s data and currency are technically at the whim of their bank or government. if a user’s bank is hacked, the client’s private information is at risk. if the client’s bank collapses or the client lives in a country with an unstable government, the value of their currency may be at risk. in 2008, several failing banks were bailed out—partially using taxpayer money. these are the worries out of which bitcoin was first conceived and developed.",1
"by spreading its operations across a network of computers, blockchain allows bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to operate without the need for a central authority. this not only reduces risk but also eliminates many of the processing and transaction fees. it can also give those in countries with unstable currencies or financial infrastructures a more stable currency with more applications and a wider network of individuals and institutions with whom they can do business, both domestically and internationally.",1
"using cryptocurrency wallets for savings accounts or as a means of payment is especially profound for those who have no state identification. some countries may be war-torn or have governments that lack any real infrastructure to provide identification. citizens of such countries may not have access to savings or brokerage accounts—and, therefore, no way to safely store wealth.",1
"this process is not just costly and time-consuming—it is also prone to human error, where each inaccuracy makes tracking property ownership less efficient. blockchain has the potential to eliminate the need for scanning documents and tracking down physical files in a local recording office. if property ownership is stored and verified on the blockchain, owners can trust that their deed is accurate and permanently recorded.",1
"in war-torn countries or areas that have little to no government or financial infrastructure, and certainly no recorder’s office, it can be nearly impossible to prove ownership of a property. if a group of people living in such an area is able to leverage blockchain, then transparent and clear time lines of property ownership could be established.",1
"a smart contract is a computer code that can be built into the blockchain to facilitate, verify, or negotiate a contract agreement. smart contracts operate under a set of conditions to which users agree. when those conditions are met, the terms of the agreement are automatically carried out.",1
"say, for example, that a potential tenant would like to lease an apartment using a smart contract. the landlord agrees to give the tenant the door code to the apartment as soon as the tenant pays the security deposit. both the tenant and the landlord would send their respective portions of the deal to the smart contract, which would hold onto and automatically exchange the door code for the security deposit on the date when the lease begins. if the landlord doesn’t supply the door code by the lease date, then the smart contract refunds the security deposit. this would eliminate the fees and processes typically associated with the use of a notary, a third-party mediator, or attorneys.",0
"as in the ibm food trust example, suppliers can use blockchain to record the origins of materials that they have purchased. this would allow companies to verify the authenticity of not only their products but also common labels such as “organic,” “local,” and “fair trade.”",1
"blockchain does not store any of its information in a central location. instead, the blockchain is copied and spread across a network of computers. whenever a new block is added to the blockchain, every computer on the network updates its blockchain to reflect the change. by spreading that information across a network, rather than storing it in one central database, blockchain becomes more difficult to tamper with. if a copy of the blockchain fell into the hands of a hacker, only a single copy of the information, rather than the entire network, would be compromised.",1
"transactions placed through a central authority can take up to a few days to settle. if you attempt to deposit a check on friday evening, for example, you may not actually see funds in your account until monday morning. whereas financial institutions operate during business hours, usually five days a week, blockchain is working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year. transactions can be completed in as little as 10 minutes and can be considered secure after just a few hours. this is particularly useful for cross-border trades, which usually take much longer because of time zone issues and the fact that all parties must confirm payment processing.",1
"many blockchain networks operate as public databases, meaning that anyone with an internet connection can view a list of the network’s transaction history. although users can access details about transactions, they cannot access identifying information about the users making those transactions. it is a common misperception that blockchain networks like bitcoin are anonymous, when in fact they are only confidential.",1
"when a user makes a public transaction, their unique code—called a public key, as mentioned earlier—is recorded on the blockchain. their personal information is not. if a person has made a bitcoin purchase on an exchange that requires identification, then the person’s identity is still linked to their blockchain address—but a transaction, even when tied to a person’s name, does not reveal any personal information.",1
"once a transaction is recorded, its authenticity must be verified by the blockchain network. thousands of computers on the blockchain rush to confirm that the details of the purchase are correct. after a computer has validated the transaction, it is added to the blockchain block. each block on the blockchain contains its own unique hash, along with the unique hash of the block before it. when the information on a block is edited in any way, that block’s hash code changes—however, the hash code on the block after it would not. this discrepancy makes it extremely difficult for information on the blockchain to be changed without notice.",1
"most blockchains are entirely open-source software. this means that anyone and everyone can view its code. this gives auditors the ability to review cryptocurrencies like bitcoin for security. this also means that there is no real authority on who controls bitcoin’s code or how it is edited. because of this, anyone can suggest changes or upgrades to the system. if a majority of the network users agree that the new version of the code with the upgrade is sound and worthwhile, then bitcoin can be updated.",1
"these people often earn a little money that is paid in physical cash. they then need to store this physical cash in hidden locations in their homes or other places of living, leaving them subject to robbery or unnecessary violence. keys to a bitcoin wallet can be stored on a piece of paper, a cheap cell phone, or even memorized if necessary. for most people, it is likely that these options are more easily hidden than a small pile of cash under a mattress.",1
"despite the costs of mining bitcoin, users continue to drive up their electricity bills to validate transactions on the blockchain. that’s because when miners add a block to the bitcoin blockchain, they are rewarded with enough bitcoin to make their time and energy worthwhile. when it comes to blockchains that do not use cryptocurrency, however, miners will need to be paid or otherwise incentivized to validate transactions.",1
"some solutions to these issues are beginning to arise. for example, bitcoin-mining farms have been set up to use solar power, excess natural gas from fracking sites, or power from wind farms.",1
"the other issue is that each block can only hold so much data. the block size debate has been, and continues to be, one of the most pressing issues for the scalability of blockchains going forward.",0
"many in the crypto space have expressed concerns about government regulation over cryptocurrencies. while it is getting increasingly difficult and near impossible to end something like bitcoin as its decentralized network grows, governments could theoretically make it illegal to own cryptocurrencies or participate in their networks.",1
"simply put, a blockchain is a shared database or ledger. pieces of data are stored in data structures known as blocks, and each node of the network has an exact replica of the entire database. security is ensured since if somebody tries to edit or delete an entry in one copy of the ledger, the majority will not reflect this change and it will be rejected.",1
"a public blockchain, also known as an open or permissionless blockchain, is one where anybody can join the network freely and establish a node. because of their open nature, these blockchains must be secured with cryptography and a consensus system like proof of work (pow).",1
"a private or permissioned blockchain, on the other hand, requires each node to be approved before joining. because nodes are considered to be trusted, the layers of security do not need to be as robust.",1
"with many practical applications for the technology already being implemented and explored, blockchain is finally making a name for itself in no small part because of bitcoin and cryptocurrency. as a buzzword on the tongue of every investor in the nation, blockchain stands to make business and government operations more accurate, efficient, secure, and cheap, with fewer middlemen.",1
"as we prepare to head into the third decade of blockchain, it’s no longer a question of if legacy companies will catch on to the technology—it’s a question of when. today, we see a proliferation of nfts and the tokenization of assets. the next decades will prove to be an important period of growth for blockchain.",0

"to use conventional banking as an analogy, the blockchain is like a full history of banking transactions. bitcoin transactions are entered chronologically in a blockchain just the way bank transactions are. blocks, meanwhile, are like individual bank statements.",1
"contracts, transactions, and records of them provide critical structure in our economic system, but they haven’t kept up with the world’s digital transformation. they’re like rush-hour gridlock trapping a formula 1 race car.",0
"like tcp/ip (on which the internet was built), blockchain is a foundational technology that will require broad coordination. the level of complexity—technological, regulatory, and social—will be unprecedented.",1
"the adoption of tcp/ip suggests blockchain will follow a fairly predictable path. while the journey will take years, it’s not too early for businesses to start planning.",0
"every transaction and its associated value are visible to anyone with access to the system. each node, or user, on a blockchain has a unique 30-plus-character alphanumeric address that identifies it. users can choose to remain anonymous or provide proof of their identity to others. transactions occur between blockchain addresses.",1
the digital nature of the ledger means that blockchain transactions can be tied to computational logic and in essence programmed. so users can set up algorithms and rules that automatically trigger transactions between nodes.,1
"indeed, virtually everyone has heard the claim that blockchain will revolutionize business and redefine companies and economies. although we share the enthusiasm for its potential, we worry about the hype. it’s not just security issues (such as the 2014 collapse of one bitcoin exchange and the more recent hacks of others) that concern us. our experience studying technological innovation tells us that if there’s to be a blockchain revolution, many barriers—technological, governance, organizational, and even societal—will have to fall. it would be a mistake to rush headlong into blockchain innovation without understanding how it is likely to take hold.",0
"introduced in 1972, tcp/ip first gained traction in a single-use case: as the basis for e-mail among the researchers on arpanet, the u.s. department of defense precursor to the commercial internet. before tcp/ip, telecommunications architecture was based on “circuit switching,” in which connections between two parties or machines had to be preestablished and sustained throughout an exchange. to ensure that any two nodes could communicate, telecom service providers and equipment manufacturers had invested billions in building dedicated lines.",0
"tcp/ip turned that model on its head. the new protocol transmitted information by digitizing it and breaking it up into very small packets, each including address information. once released into the network, the packets could take any route to the recipient. smart sending and receiving nodes at the network’s edges could disassemble and reassemble the packets and interpret the encoded data. there was no need for dedicated private lines or massive infrastructure. tcp/ip created an open, shared public network without any central authority or party responsible for its maintenance and improvement.",0
"tcp/ip burst into broad public use with the advent of the world wide web in the mid-1990s. new technology companies quickly emerged to provide the “plumbing”—the hardware, software, and services needed to connect to the now-public network and exchange information. netscape commercialized browsers, web servers, and other tools and components that aided the development and adoption of internet services and applications. sun drove the development of java, the application-programming language. as information on the web grew exponentially, infoseek, excite, altavista, and yahoo were born to guide users around it.",1
"once this basic infrastructure gained critical mass, a new generation of companies took advantage of low-cost connectivity by creating internet services that were compelling substitutes for existing businesses. cnet moved news online. amazon offered more books for sale than any bookshop. priceline and expedia made it easier to buy airline tickets and brought unprecedented transparency to the process. the ability of these newcomers to get extensive reach at relatively low cost put significant pressure on traditional businesses like newspapers and brick-and-mortar retailers.",1
"relying on broad internet connectivity, the next wave of companies created novel, transformative applications that fundamentally changed the way businesses created and captured value. these companies were built on a new peer-to-peer architecture and generated value by coordinating distributed networks of users. think of how ebay changed online retail through auctions, napster changed the music industry, skype changed telecommunications, and google, which exploited user-generated links to provide more relevant results, changed web search.",1
"ultimately, it took more than 30 years for tcp/ip to move through all the phases—single use, localized use, substitution, and transformation—and reshape the economy. today more than half the world’s most valuable public companies have internet-driven, platform-based business models. the very foundations of our economy have changed. physical scale and unique intellectual property no longer confer unbeatable advantages; increasingly, the economic leaders are enterprises that act as “keystones,” proactively organizing, influencing, and coordinating widespread networks of communities, users, and organizations.",0
"blockchain—a peer-to-peer network that sits on top of the internet—was introduced in october 2008 as part of a proposal for bitcoin, a virtual currency system that eschewed a central authority for issuing currency, transferring ownership, and confirming transactions. bitcoin is the first application of blockchain technology.",1
"for example, a typical stock transaction can be executed within microseconds, often without human intervention. however, the settlement—the ownership transfer of the stock—can take as long as a week. that’s because the parties have no access to each other’s ledgers and can’t automatically verify that the assets are in fact owned and can be transferred. instead a series of intermediaries act as guarantors of assets as the record of the transaction traverses organizations and the ledgers are individually updated.",1
"in a blockchain system, the ledger is replicated in a large number of identical databases, each hosted and maintained by an interested party. when changes are entered in one copy, all the other copies are simultaneously updated. so as transactions occur, records of the value and assets exchanged are permanently entered in all ledgers. there is no need for third-party intermediaries to verify or transfer ownership. if a stock transaction took place on a blockchain-based system, it would be settled within seconds, securely and verifiably. (the infamous hacks that have hit bitcoin exchanges exposed weaknesses not in the blockchain itself but in separate systems linked to parties using the blockchain.)",0
"if bitcoin is like early e-mail, is blockchain decades from reaching its full potential? in our view the answer is a qualified yes. we can’t predict exactly how many years the transformation will take, but we can guess which kinds of applications will gain traction first and how blockchain’s broad acceptance will eventually come about.",0
"the adoption of foundational technologies typically happens in four phases. each phase is defined by the novelty of the applications and the complexity of the coordination efforts needed to make them workable. applications low in novelty and complexity gain acceptance first. applications high in novelty and complexity take decades to evolve but can transform the economy. tcp/ip technology, introduced on arpanet in 1972, has already reached the transformation phase, but blockchain applications (in red) are in their early days.",1
"in our analysis, history suggests that two dimensions affect how a foundational technology and its business use cases evolve. the first is novelty—the degree to which an application is new to the world. the more novel it is, the more effort will be required to ensure that users understand what problems it solves. the second dimension is complexity, represented by the level of ecosystem coordination involved—the number and diversity of parties that need to work together to produce value with the technology. for example, a social network with just one member is of little use; a social network is worthwhile only when many of your own connections have signed on to it. other users of the application must be brought on board to generate value for all participants. the same will be true for many blockchain applications. and, as the scale and impact of those applications increase, their adoption will require significant institutional change.",0
"we’ve developed a framework that maps innovations against these two contextual dimensions, dividing them into quadrants. (see the exhibit “how foundational technologies take hold.”) each quadrant represents a stage of technology development. identifying which one a blockchain innovation falls into will help executives understand the types of challenges it presents, the level of collaboration and consensus it needs, and the legislative and regulatory efforts it will require. the map will also suggest what kind of processes and infrastructure must be established to facilitate the innovation’s adoption. managers can use it to assess the state of blockchain development in any industry, as well as to evaluate strategic investments in their own blockchain capabilities.",0
"in the first quadrant are low-novelty and low-coordination applications that create better, less costly, highly focused solutions. e-mail, a cheap alternative to phone calls, faxes, and snail mail, was a single-use application for tcp/ip (even though its value rose with the number of users). bitcoin, too, falls into this quadrant. even in its early days, bitcoin offered immediate value to the few people who used it simply as an alternative payment method. (you can think of it as a complex e-mail that transfers not just information but also actual value.) at the end of 2016 the value of bitcoin transactions was expected to hit $92 billion. that’s still a rounding error compared with the $411 trillion in total global payments, but bitcoin is growing fast and increasingly important in contexts such as instant payments and foreign currency and asset trading, where the present financial system has limitations.",0
"the second quadrant comprises innovations that are relatively high in novelty but need only a limited number of users to create immediate value, so it’s still relatively easy to promote their adoption. if blockchain follows the path network technologies took in business, we can expect blockchain innovations to build on single-use applications to create local private networks on which multiple organizations are connected through a distributed ledger.",0
"the third quadrant contains applications that are relatively low in novelty because they build on existing single-use and localized applications, but are high in coordination needs because they involve broader and increasingly public uses. these innovations aim to replace entire ways of doing business. they face high barriers to adoption, however; not only do they require more coordination but the processes they hope to replace may be full-blown and deeply embedded within organizations and institutions. examples of substitutes include cryptocurrencies—new, fully formed currency systems that have grown out of the simple bitcoin payment technology. the critical difference is that a cryptocurrency requires every party that does monetary transactions to adopt it, challenging governments and institutions that have long handled and overseen such transactions. consumers also have to change their behavior and understand how to implement the new functional capability of the cryptocurrency.",1
"a recent experiment at mit highlights the challenges ahead for digital currency systems. in 2014 the mit bitcoin club provided each of mit’s 4,494 undergraduates with $100 in bitcoin. interestingly, 30% of the students did not even sign up for the free money, and 20% of the sign-ups converted the bitcoin to cash within a few weeks. even the technically savvy had a tough time understanding how or where to use bitcoin.",1
"one of the most ambitious substitute blockchain applications is stellar, a nonprofit that aims to bring affordable financial services, including banking, micropayments, and remittances, to people who’ve never had access to them. stellar offers its own virtual currency, lumens, and also allows users to retain on its system a range of assets, including other currencies, telephone minutes, and data credits. stellar initially focused on africa, particularly nigeria, the largest economy there. it has seen significant adoption among its target population and proved its cost-effectiveness. but its future is by no means certain, because the ecosystem coordination challenges are high. although grassroots adoption has demonstrated the viability of stellar, to become a banking standard, it will need to influence government policy and persuade central banks and large organizations to use it. that could take years of concerted effort.",1
"into the last quadrant fall completely novel applications that, if successful, could change the very nature of economic, social, and political systems. they involve coordinating the activity of many actors and gaining institutional agreement on standards and processes. their adoption will require major social, legal, and political change.",0
"the implications are fascinating. firms are built on contracts, from incorporation to buyer-supplier relationships to employee relations. if contracts are automated, then what will happen to traditional firm structures, processes, and intermediaries like lawyers and accountants? and what about managers? their roles would all radically change. before we get too excited here, though, let’s remember that we are decades away from the widespread adoption of smart contracts. they cannot be effective, for instance, without institutional buy-in. a tremendous degree of coordination and clarity on how smart contracts are designed, verified, implemented, and enforced will be required. we believe the institutions responsible for those daunting tasks will take a long time to evolve. and the technology challenges—especially security—are daunting.",0
"for most, the easiest place to start is single-use applications, which minimize risk because they aren’t new and involve little coordination with third parties. one strategy is to add bitcoin as a payment mechanism. the infrastructure and market for bitcoin are already well developed, and adopting the virtual currency will force a variety of functions, including it, finance, accounting, sales, and marketing, to build blockchain capabilities. another low-risk approach is to use blockchain internally as a database for applications like managing physical and digital assets, recording internal transactions, and verifying identities. this may be an especially useful solution for companies struggling to reconcile multiple internal databases. testing out single-use applications will help organizations develop the skills they need for more-advanced applications. and thanks to the emergence of cloud-based blockchain services from both start-ups and large platforms like amazon and microsoft, experimentation is getting easier all the time.",0
"localized applications are a natural next step for companies. we’re seeing a lot of investment in private blockchain networks right now, and the projects involved seem poised for real short-term impact. financial services companies, for example, are finding that the private blockchain networks they’ve set up with a limited number of trusted counterparties can significantly reduce transaction costs.",1
"organizations can also tackle specific problems in transactions across boundaries with localized applications. companies are already using blockchain to track items through complex supply chains, for instance. this is happening in the diamond industry, where gems are being traced from mines to consumers. the technology for such experiments is now available off-the-shelf.",0
"developing substitute applications requires careful planning, since existing solutions may be difficult to dislodge. one way to go may be to focus on replacements that won’t require end users to change their behavior much but present alternatives to expensive or unattractive solutions. to get traction, substitutes must deliver functionality as good as a traditional solution’s and must be easy for the ecosystem to absorb and adopt. first data’s foray into blockchain-based gift cards is a good example of a well-considered substitute. retailers that offer them to consumers can dramatically lower costs per transaction and enhance security by using blockchain to track the flows of currency within accounts—without relying on external payment processors. these new gift cards even allow transfers of balances and transaction capability between merchants via the common ledger.",0
transformative applications are still far away. but it makes sense to evaluate their possibilities now and invest in developing technology that can enable them. they will be most powerful when tied to a new business model in which the logic of value creation and capture departs from existing approaches. such business models are hard to adopt but can unlock future growth for companies.,0
"consider how law firms will have to change to make smart contracts viable. they’ll need to develop new expertise in software and blockchain programming. they’ll probably also have to rethink their hourly payment model and entertain the idea of charging transaction or hosting fees for contracts, to name just two possible approaches. whatever tack they take, executives must be sure they understand and have tested the business model implications before making any switch.",0
"transformative scenarios will take off last, but they will also deliver enormous value. two areas where they could have a profound impact: large-scale public identity systems for such functions as passport control, and algorithm-driven decision making in the prevention of money laundering and in complex financial transactions that involve many parties. we expect these applications won’t reach broad adoption and critical mass for at least another decade and probably more.",1
"transformative applications will also give rise to new platform-level players that will coordinate and govern the new ecosystems. these will be the googles and facebooks of the next generation. it will require patience to realize such opportunities. though it may be premature to start making significant investments in them now, developing the required foundations for them—tools and standards—is still worthwhile.",0
"in addition to providing a good template for blockchain’s adoption, tcp/ip has most likely smoothed the way for it. tcp/ip has become ubiquitous, and blockchain applications are being built on top of the digital data, communication, and computation infrastructure, which lowers the cost of experimentation and will allow new use cases to emerge rapidly.",0
"with our framework, executives can figure out where to start building their organizational capabilities for blockchain today. they need to ensure that their staffs learn about blockchain, to develop company-specific applications across the quadrants we’ve identified, and to invest in blockchain infrastructure.",0
"but given the time horizons, barriers to adoption, and sheer complexity involved in getting to tcp/ip levels of acceptance, executives should think carefully about the risks involved in experimenting with blockchain. clearly, starting small is a good way to develop the know-how to think bigger. but the level of investment should depend on the context of the company and the industry. financial services companies are already well down the road to blockchain adoption. manufacturing is not.",1

"bitcoin has been criticised for the vast energy reserves and associated carbon footprint of the system. new bitcoins are created by “mining” coins, which is done by using computers to carry out complex calculations. the more bitcoins that have been ""mined"", the longer it takes to mine new coin, and the more electricity is used in the process.",1
"the more electricity you burn, and the faster your computer, the higher your chance of winning the competition. the prize? 12.5 bitcoin – still worth over $100,000 – plus all the transaction fees paid in the past 10 minutes, which according analysts’ estimates is another $2,500 or so.",1
the economic outcome of all of this is laid bare in a credit suisse briefing note published on tuesday: the network as a whole will reinvest almost all the bitcoin paid out as mining rewards back into its electricity consumption. (credit suisse’s ballpark figure assumes that 80% of the expenses of bitcoin miners are spent on electricity).,1
"at current prices for electricity and bitcoin, the bank calculates a maximum profitable power draw of bitcoin at around 100twh – two-and-a-half times higher than its current rate. any higher and the miner will lose money.",1
"but it gets worse. if bitcoin were to become the global currency its supporters hope it will, its pricewould increase. and if its price increases, so too does the amount of electricity miners can afford to burn.",1
"credit suisse estimate that a bitcoin price of $50,000 – five times its level as i write – would increase the electricity consumption tenfold. and at a bitcoin price of $1.1m, it would be profitable to use almost all the electricity currently generated in the world for mining.",1
"the bank views the latter prospect as not worth worrying about, for two reasons: it doesn’t think bitcoin will ever reach that value, since the competition from other cryptocurrencies is too strong; and it thinks that power consumption of mining will fall over time as better technologies are used for miners. credit suisse explicitly compares bitcoin to marijuana cultivation and data centres, two other industries that once sparked fears they would have huge power draws.",1
"i’m not convinced we should be so blasé. it’s true that bitcoin may face competition from other cryptocurrencies, but almost all its competitors use essentially the same wasteful mining system it does. if they took over pole position, it would be out of the frying pan and into the fire. (one major competitor, ethereum, has long discussed moving to a “proof-of-stake” system, which would radically change its power use for the better, but the switchover still hasn’t happened. it’s currently scheduled for mid-2018.)",1
"and while marijuana farmers and data centre engineers managed to reduce their power demands, the fundamentally wasteful nature of bitcoin mining means there’s no easy technological solution coming.",1
"mining computers have become more power-efficient, with the latest generation of machines able to do roughly 20% more useless calculations per mwh of electricity. but in the zero-sum game of bitcoin mining, that just means a miner can afford to run more machines at the same time, leaving their power usage roughly stable.",1
"on that point, there is good news to be had: bitcoin is down to just over $10,000, almost half the level it was trading at a month ago. if it continues to fall, we might be able to return to worrying about more conventional sources of climate change, like the automotive industry, plane travel, and donald trump.",1
"bitcoin is the first, and the biggest, ""cryptocurrency"" – a decentralised tradable digital asset. whether it is a bad investment is the big question. bitcoin can only be used as a medium of exchange and in practice has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. the lack of any central authority makes bitcoin remarkably resilient to censorship, corruption – or regulation. that means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person.",1

"china -- home to about three-quarters of the machines plumbing the blockchain -- dominated the scene until the communist government halted trading of virtual currency, banned initial coin offerings and shut down mining in recent months. some of the most influential companies in the new crypto economy, whose roughly 1,500 digital currencies were worth about $405 billion on friday, are discovering the great white north.",1
"beijing-based bitmain technologies ltd., the world’s biggest bitcoin mining organization, operates in quebec, while btc.top, the largest mining collective, is opening a facility in canada, the founders said. after scouring the globe, amsterdam-based bitfury group ltd. found that drumheller, alberta -- where dinosaurs once roamed -- is one of the most profitable places in the world to chase digital coins. the largest bitcoin miner outside of china has set up 58 megawatts of data centers there, a third of its global capacity, according to an investor presentation.",1
"the largest variable cost in crypto mining is electricity. chinese miners gained an edge thanks to cheap coal-fired power and a system that allowed them to skirt taxes and grid fees, according to bloomberg new energy finance. with electricity demand from crypto miners set to exceed that from electric vehicles in coming years, the hunt for new markets is narrowing to canada and a handful of nordic countries, bloomberg intelligence analyst elchin mammadov said in a report.",1
"comparing costs across geographies is tricky because taxes, distribution charges, labor and transport costs can greatly swing the bottom line. iceland has attracted major miners, including bitfury and genesis mining ltd., builder of the world’s largest ether mining facility. norway stands out as having the lowest industrial electricity prices among advanced economies, according to data from the international energy agency.",1
"in canada, hydro-quebec was quick to lay out the welcome mat. the country’s largest hydroelectricity generator, which earlier lured amazon.com inc. and microsoft corp. data centers to the province, was in talks with about 30 crypto miners in early january, according to hydro-quebec spokesman marc-antoine pouliot.",1
"less than three weeks later, that number had swelled to over 100 fueled in part by the flood of chinese miners seeking to move their rigs elsewhere. the utility has a surplus for provincial needs alone of 10 terawatt-hours or enough to power 600,000 homes -- for a decade.",1
"hydro-quebec envisions demand from crypto miners in the province could rise to as much as 5 terawatt-hours of electricity. globally, morgan stanley forecasts blockchain diggers could require as much as 140 terawatt-hours of electricity by the end of 2018. that’s nearly 1 percent of global demand.",1
"""ontario, manitoba, quebec -- in canada, we have so much stranded power and huge infrastructure that’s being underutilized,"" said sean clark, chief executive officer of hut 8 mining corp., a vancouver-based crypto miner backed by bitfury. still, electricity prices alone don’t cut it -- otherwise venezuela and russia would be in the running. “it’s important to have the rule of law.""",1
there’s also one other thing that canada offers to miners requiring millions to buy rigs: it’s a relatively easy place for venture companies to raise money.,1
"in the past, that’s what made canada home to a large number of the world’s traditional hard-rock mining companies. but financing for mineral exploration has dried up on canadian exchanges -- and some of the speculative capital is racing to crypto stocks.",1
"at least 50 blockchain and crypto-related firms are set to list in canada this year, thanks in part to a junior market that’s more comfortable with risk than elsewhere, harris fricker, ceo of securities firm gmp capital inc., said in a december interview. among them are dmg blockchain solutions inc. and hut 8, according to their ceos.",1
"now the race is for scale in a sector where larger players can more easily survive the wild swings of virtual currencies. bitcoin for example, has plunged 50 percent since mid-january to about $9,017, amid concerns about overvaluation regulation and security.",1
"by the end of the year, bitfarms plans to expand its mining capacity nearly seven fold to 187 megawatts, while dmg expects to have 160 megawatts across three sites in b.c. by mid-2018, hut 8 will have acquired nearly 60 megawatts of bitfury’s canadian capacity and the firms jointly could build out ""hundreds of megawatts"" more in as little as 18 months, says hut 8’s clark.",1

"china's ban on cryptocurrency mining has forced bitcoin entrepreneurs to flee overseas. many are heading to texas, which is quickly becoming the next global cryptocurrency capital.",1
"when china announced a crackdown on bitcoin mining and trading in may, kevin pan, ceo of chinese cryptocurrency mining company poolin, got on a flight the next day to leave the country.",1
"headquartered in hong kong, poolin is the second largest bitcoin mining network in the world, with most of its operations in mainland china. the country was home to around 70% of global bitcoin mining power, until the clampdown sent the price of bitcoin into a tailspin and caught miners off guard.",1
"now china's ""bitcoin refugees"" are urgently scrambling to find a new home, whether in neighbouring kazakhstan, russia or north america, because for bitcoin miners, time is literally money.",1
"""we had to find a new location for the [bitcoin mining] machines,"" poolin's vice-president alejandro de la torres said. ""because every minute that the machine is not on, it's not making money.""",1
"in what some call the ""great mining migration,"" the poolin executives are among the many bitcoin miners who have recently landed in a place reputed as part of america's wild wild west: austin, texas.",1
they are created when a computer 'mines' the money by solving a complex set of maths problems and that is how bitcoin 'miners' who run the computers earn the currency.,1
"as a new form of money that transcends national boundaries, there is also much confusion and potential to run afoul of government rules - so two things bitcoin entrepreneurs value are cheap electricity and a relaxed regulatory environment.",1

"governor of texas greg abbott has been a vocal supporter for cryptocurrency. ""it's happening! texas will be the crypto leader,"" he tweeted in june. in the same month, the lone star state became the second us state after wyoming to recognise blockchain and cryptocurrency in its commercial law, paving the way for crypto businesses to operate in the state.",1
"many chinese bitcoin companies have looked to texas for stability and opportunity. shenzhen-based firm bit mining has planned to invest $26 million to build a data centre in the state, while beijing-based bitmain is expanding its facility in rockdale, texas. this small town with around 5,600 residents once housed one of the world's largest aluminium plants, and now it's emerging as the next global hub for bitcoin mining.",1
"""the migration benefits the us in terms of talent acquisition and furthering the innovation ecosystem,"" says kevin desouza, a business professor at the queensland university of technology who has done research on china's digital currency policy. in return, the bitcoin miners get access to a thriving and innovative community, as well as more diverse sources of capital, according to prof desouza.",1
"texas has some of the cheapest energy prices in the world, due to its deregulated power grid. consumers enjoy more choices of electricity providers, which encourage providers to lower prices to stay competitive. during peaks of electricity demand, bitcoin farms can even sell unused power back to the grid.",1
"although el salvador is set to become the first country to adopt bitcoin as a national currency, bitcoin miners prefer the us because of its well-developed electrical infrastructure, says mr de la torre.",1
"but some analysts warn that the ""great mining migration"" may lead to serious repercussions, as cities and towns struggle to meet the huge energy appetite.",1
"in february, blackouts following a deadly snowstorm left millions of homes and businesses in texas without power for days. more than 200 people died. during the power outage, bitcoin farms were compensated to stay offline.",1
"the increased scrutiny of chinese companies in america may also lead to more attention on these mining newcomers. texas recently passed a law that prevents ""hostile foreign actors"" from accessing critical infrastructure, including its power grid. the new law was reportedly prompted by a chinese billionaire's plan to build a wind farm in southwest texas. critics allege that the project could be used to hack into the texas energy grid and to gather intelligence from a nearby us military base.",1
"prof desouza says that while access to electricity grids is unlikely to be an issue for bitcoin miners in the short term, political risk will continue to evolve.",1
"according to mr pan, while a new bitcoin farm takes up to five months to build in china, it could take as long as 18 months in texas. global shipping prices have also skyrocketed during the pandemic, making it significantly more expensive to ship mining machines from china to the us.",1
"despite the costly and time-consuming efforts, mr pan says his company is committed to settle in texas, ""it's a free land, and a lot of bitcoiners are here,"" he says, ""so we feel: 'whoa, family reunion.'""",1

calgary -- iron bridge resources inc. has announced the formation and launch of a wholly-owned cryptocurrency mining and hosting operation called iron chain technology corp. (ict).,1
"ict will own and operate cryptocurrency mining data centers at canadian oil and gas field sites, taking advantage of cheap, clean burning natural gas to generate its own electricity. as a result of this structure and the current canadian gas price environment, ict will benefit from some of the lowest cost power in the world.",1
"the company expects to begin operating its pilot cryptocurrency mining facility near ibr’s oil and gas operations at elmworth, alberta. the company is already currently mining with equipment sourced and assembled by technology professionals who have been engaged by the company. these professionals are it systems architects who have extensive experience assembling mining equipment and have a history of profitably mining cryptocurrencies. ict is providing hosting services for a limited amount of equipment from third-parties, and expects this to be a growth area for the company. the company is currently mining bitcoin and intends to maintain flexibility with regard to the type of cryptocurrency coin that gets mined going forward.",1
"while north american natural gas prices have been weak for a number of years, the market in western canada has been significantly negatively impacted by strong supplies and persistent pipeline takeaway restrictions. this has lead to aeco prices that trade in the $1.50 per gj range in the futures market. this pricing environment, combined with the emergence of blockchain and cryptocurrencies as increasingly accepted and enduring technologies, provides an opportunity for ict to become an important infrastructure player by leveraging its sustainable power cost advantage in a safe, stable developed country.",1
"ict’s pilot cryptocurrency mining project will involve a very modest initial capex investment as a result of its ability to leverage existing infrastructure and excess power generation from ibr’s elmworth hydrocarbon processing battery, fired by ibr’s clean burning natural gas production, to provide power to the mining control center. the pilot project currently has access to approximately 700 kw of very low cost power with the ability to expand that power generation capability rapidly. the company’s parent company, iron bridge resources, currently produces enough natural gas to power a 45 mw facility and expects to significantly increase that gas production within the next two months when it brings on-stream additional montney production. ict is also in discussions with other natural gas producers to work with them on future commercial projects. as a result, the company is interested in pursuing industrial scale hosting opportunities.",1
"part of ict’s strategy involves the sourcing of cryptocurrency mining rigs using processing gear that is not experiencing the high levels of demand that many rig components currently are seeing. being located in a cold jurisdiction where power is abundantly cheap, the company is sourcing components that would be challenging to use in typical grid-connected and warmer climates.  this is expected to further reduce capital costs and could be a sustainable competitive advantage in hosting.",1

cryptocurrency mania might have gone a little too far in iceland. the region’s energy company says bitcoin mining is becoming so popular that the country will likely use more electricity to mine coins than power homes this year.,1
"that could cause problems, though, as officials warn they won’t have sufficient energy to supply the number of proposed bitcoin mining centers (if those facilities do indeed open).",1
"“if all these projects are realized, we won’t have enough energy for it,” johann snorri sigurbergsson, a spokesman for icelandic energy firm hs orka, told the bbc.",1
"bitcoin mining tools, which primarily consist of large computers, servers, and cooling devices, will use around 840 gigawatt hours of electricity this year, sigurbergsson estimated. the country’s homes, collectively, use about 700 gigawatt hours per year, he said. iceland’s population is about 340,000.",1
"iceland has become a haven for cryptocurrency miners in part because of its cheap electricity. prices are contained because nearly all of the country’s energy comes from renewable sources, prompting more mining companies to consider opening operations in iceland.",1
"icelandic government officials are starting to question the value of such operations, though. mining data centers don’t need to hire a big staff and don’t require especially large infrastructure investments. they typically pay low tax bills, as well.",1
"“under normal circumstances, companies that are creating value in iceland pay a certain amount of tax to the government,” smari mccarthy, a member of iceland’s pirate party, told the associated press. “these companies are not doing that, and we might want to ask ourselves whether they should.”",0

"bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like ethereum, ripple, and litecoin have soared in value over the past year, thanks to continued interest from a range of investors. as the price of these cryptocurrencies has increased, graphics cards have also seen big price increases thanks to retail stock shortages. a range of mid- or high-end graphics cards from amd or nvidia are in short supply, mostly due to cryptocurrency miners buying them in bulk to build machines to mine bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies.",1
"polygon reports that pricing for nvidia’s geforce gtx 1070 should be around $380 (depending on the model), but that some cards are now being sold for more than $700 due to the stock shortages – an increase of more than 80 percent. cryptocurrency miners use stacks of graphics cards to solve the mathematical problems need to authenticate payments on the network and create new bitcoin. there’s only a finite number of bitcoins available, and because of the way the network is designed, each new bitcoin takes more power to mine. this has led to increased demand for more powerful graphics cards to tackle multiple cryptocurrencies.",1
"the graphics card pricing is making it a lot harder to build a gaming pc from scratch right now, especially as the stock shortages of mid-range cards like the gtx 1060 or gtx 1070 also push up the prices of more capable cards. nvidia’s gtx 1060, gtx 1070, gtx 1080, and amd’s radeon rx 570, 580, vega 56, and vega 64 cards have all been impacted in recent months.",0
"nvidia is advising its retail partners to prioritize gamers over miners, but retailers are able to generate some impressive margins at the moment so it’s unlikely that simple advice will result in real changes. some retailers are limiting purchases so miners can’t buy stacks of cards, and polygon reports that micro center is specifically offering discounts to pc gamers who are buying the cards alongside other components. micro center blames high demand from miners and constrained shipments from vendors for the industry-wide shortages.",1
"it’s a problem that’s affecting pricing worldwide, not just in the us, and it seems unlikely to end unless graphics card vendors can flood the market to keep up with demand. it could put off pc gaming newcomers who are deciding between building a mid-range pc or opting for a playstation 4 pro / xbox one x. gamers have had to put up with volatile pricing of ram over the years, and as bitcoin and other cryptocurrency pricing continues to fluctuate it’s clear that graphics cards will be the latest bottleneck in building the perfect gaming pc.",1
"the ongoing shortage of gaming graphics cards has kept prices for amd’s and nvidia’s midrange and high-end gpus in the stratosphere, and retailers are taking steps to try to give gamers a better chance of buying the in-demand cards before cryptocurrency miners can snatch them up.",0
"in case you’re not aware of the situation, here’s what’s going on: cryptocurrency mining requires immense computational power, and miners figured out years ago that the chips in many high-end graphics cards are well-suited to the task. the values of cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and bitcoin have skyrocketed in recent months — a single bitcoin is currently worth well over $11,000, although that figure is in flux and has been trending downward since a peak above $19,000 last month. this has led people to put together “mining rigs” — after buying multiple consumer graphics cards for the necessary computing power — and then try to turn a profit on their investment by mining for cryptocurrency like ethereum.",1
"micro center has now gone even further. the company has raised gpu prices on its website in line with retailers like amazon and newegg: for example, the cheapest price for msi’s geforce gtx 1070 gaming x (msrp $459.99) is $945.99 on amazon and $988.99 on newegg; it’s not much lower at micro center, which has it listed at $919.99. however, micro center noted in its letter that it is offering further discounts for “in-store bundled components” to reach “a final price well below the market,” and advised customers to “see a store manager to receive our best price.”",1
"in other words, if you walk into a micro center to buy a graphics card as well as other pc components — as in, the kind of purchases you’d be making if you were building a gaming rig — a manager can provide a discount. some customers said in a reddit post today that they were even able to get the deals without a “bundle”; they simply told an employee that they wanted to buy a gpu for gaming purposes. to be clear, the discount will make the price more reasonable, but it probably won’t drop it all the way down to the msrp. (let’s take a second to note how strange this is: everyone usually criticizes retailers for the practice of selling hot-ticket items in expensive bundles, but here, micro center is doing it as a good-faith effort to help gaming consumers!)",0
"as the shortage continues, it seems like the only truly effective solution will be for cryptocurrency mining to become less profitable — which might only happen if the bottom falls out of the cryptocurrency market. for now, gamers are left wondering just when the bitcoin bubble will burst.",1
"digital currency miners use graphics cards from amd and nvidia to ""mine"" new coins, which can then be sold or held for future appreciation. bank of america merrill lynch said ethereum is currently one of the popular alternative coins to mine with pc graphics cards.",1

"computer hardware retailers including newegg, best buy and amazon are sold out of most amd rx 570/rx 580 and nvidia gtx 1070/1080 graphics card models as of midday monday.",1
"when cards do become available, they are often priced by third-party sellers at more than double or even triple nvidia's and amd's suggested list prices.",1
"""with availability consumed by the cryptocurrency mining market, there is little chance for any pc gamer to find a graphics card in stock, let along close to the expected price point,"" shrout research's ryan shrout wrote in an email. ""because of that, many enthusiasts and diy builders are putting off system builds and upgrades completely, setting up an unfortunate situation for all other component vendors from processors to motherboards to storage.""",1
cryptocurrency miner demand is not sustainable or predictable over the long term. these buyers tend to flee as soon as profitability wanes as they do not have any brand loyalty and only care about mining return on investment.,1
this isn't the first time the digital currency craze has led to dramatic graphic card shortages. it occurred in june of last year and during the bitcoin boom of 2013.,1
"the companies can't risk losing these customers in exchange for short-term oriented, fickle digital currency miners.perhaps amd and nvidia can work with their retailer partners and limit sales to one or two cards per household. the companies can also incorporate better mining features for their cryptocurrency-specific mining cards or even take the drastic step of altering gaming graphics card firmware to limit mining functionality.",1
pc enthusiasts are suffering as digital currency miners drive up graphics card prices and cause big shortages again. sellers are charging double or triple list prices for popular amd and nvidia gaming cards on third-party marketplaces.,1
"three weeks into 2018, it remains almost impossible to find a gaming graphics card selling for anywhere near its retail price, regardless of whether you’re looking for a gpu from nvidia or amd. the monthslong shortage, fueled by a rush on graphics cards that’s driven by people looking to mine ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, continues to confound individuals that just want to buy a video card and use it in a gaming computer to, y’know, play pc games. now it seems that nvidia is trying to prioritize those customers over miners — or rather, push retailers to do so.",1
"for much of 2017, the increased demand for gpus drove the cost of powerful cards — like nvidia’s geforce gtx 1070, gtx 1080 and gtx 1080 ti, and amd’s radeon rx 570, 580, vega 56 and vega 64 — well above their suggested retail prices. for instance, the gtx 1070’s msrp is $380, but it was selling for upward of $450 last year. lower-end cards like the gtx 1050 and 1060 weren’t affected initially, but miners have moved on to them as the better cards have sold out, pushing up prices for the cheaper gpus as well. and as the value of bitcoin spiked in december, prices rose even further.",1
"“gamers come first for nvidia,” said boris böhles, pr manager for nvidia in the german region, in an interview with the german publication computerbase. “all activities around our geforce products are for our core audience. we recommend our trading partners make arrangements to ensure that gamers’ needs are still met in the current climate.”",0
"a representative for nvidia declined further comment to polygon, citing the company’s quiet period. (nvidia’s next quarterly earnings report arrives in roughly two weeks.)",0
"it’s unclear how far retailers can or would be willing to go in this respect. many of them have already tried limiting gpu purchases to one or two per customer, hoping to block miners looking to buy graphics cards in bulk. but that tactic seems to have been ineffective, if current prices are any indication. the gtx 1070 — which, remember, has an msrp of $380 — is out of stock at retailers like newegg, where it’s fetching upward of $900 from third-party sellers.",1

"speculation mounted that a major holder of cryptocurrency with an electronic wallet that dated back to 2011 -- long before anyone had heard of hodl -- was moving to sell. his or her wallet had once had as many as 111,114 bitcoins, which at their peak would have been worth about $2 billion. the rumors that began two weeks ago were that this whale -- as big holders are known -- was looking to cash out after this year’s plunge in prices.",1
"the case has all the elements of a classic bitcoin mystery: famous wallets, a vicious cycle of speculation reinforcing a selloff and intense amateur sleuthing on the internet that might not have exactly hit the mark. it also shows what makes bitcoin unique: the pseudonymous, public nature of its blockchain means anyone can attempt to trace transactions.",1
"according to chainalysis inc., which provides cryptocurrency tracking tools to companies and law enforcement, 50 transactions involving a total of 50,500 bitcoins originating from that whale’s wallet were moved between aug. 23 and 30. based on aug. 22’s closing price in bloomberg’s composite data, they would be worth about $320 million. chainalysis said they cannot confirm that the coins entered exchanges.",1
"“this is actually really interesting because of the reddit detective work that’s been happening and just people making these assumptions that this whale is cashing out,” said kim grauer, senior economist at chainalysis in new york. “it leads to conspiracy theories that someone’s trying to sabotage bitcoin -- just from someone doing an administrative move of their funds for security purposes, or we don’t even know why they have done it.”",1
"chainalysis’s software helps detect money laundering by mapping relationships between addresses, which enables it to identify at least one counterparty in about 80 percent of transactions, grauer said.",1
"the narrative is also complicated by the fact that while the 50,500 bitcoins originated from the whale (address: 1933phfhk3zgfqnlgsdxvqcn32k2buxy8a), most were scattered in 2014 to various wallets that might all be controlled by the same person -- or not -- and later moved to one wallet again. according to chainalysis, there were only small transactions associated with this stash until last year, when a thousand bitcoins were cashed out from the original address. then there was again a period of little movement -- until august.",1

"cryptocurrencies seem like a natural alternative for exchanging value that can avoid the watchful eye of state actors, powerful corporations, hackers, and others who might be well-positioned to build a dossier of one's activities. however, a lack of appropriate regulation generally burdens cryptocurrency users with practical limitations and risks. the risks include the lack of financial products and services, the inability to earn interest, basic consumer protection, and the absence of legal infrastructure for adjudicating disputes. china has also restricted the use of cryptocurrency exchanges as a means of addressing capital outflows (chen and zhao, 2018).",1
"banks and other financial intermediaries in many jurisdictions around the world are subject to anti-money laundering (aml) or “know your customer” (kyc) regulations that require them to collect data on individual accountholders and others who make use of their services (gov.uk, 2014; better business finance, 2017). the penalties for non-compliance are potentially severe. in recent years, banks have dedicated significant resources to building and maintaining compliance infrastructure, evidenced by the thousands of employees that they have hired to monitor “high-risk” transactions, as well as “tens of thousands of costly customer calls every month to refresh kyc documents” (breslow et al., 2017).",1
"an international organization named the financial action task force (fatf) was established by the g7 in 1989 as a trans-national effort to monitor financial activities, with the stated purpose of investigating and preventing money laundering and terrorist financing (financial action task force, 2018). fatf provides one of the mechanisms by which aml/kyc regulations in different jurisdictions are promulgated and coordinated. fatf also publishes a blacklist of nations who fail to enforce rules that facilitate the identification and investigation of individual accountholders, with the purpose of coordinating sanctions that force blacklisted nations to conform (financial action task force, 2013).",1
"the financial regulations imposed by economically powerful jurisdictions such as the united states and the european union share common features. in the us, aml regulations provide for customer identification and monitoring, as well as the reporting of suspicious activities (united states securities and exchange commission, 2017). in the eu, directive (eu) 2018/843 (“5amld”) requires that every financial transaction must be associated with an account, and that every account must be associated with a strongly identified responsible individual (european parliament, 2018). the directive also significantly reduces the maximum allowed value for prepaid cards and stipulates that remote transactions above eur 50 must be accompanied by customer identification (european parliament, 2018). note that 5amld specifically includes cryptocurrencies as subject to its prescribed regulations on financial transfers.",1
"although the systematic collection of identifying information for individual accountholders might facilitate important investigations, it also provides a mechanism by which authorities can browse comprehensive or near-comprehensive financial information about individuals without their knowledge. authorities with those capabilities, and the businesses positioned to aggregate and analyse data collected for compliance purposes, may also be able to conduct statistical evaluations of individuals based upon the information available to their financial institutions. once aggregated and linked to unitary identities, the transaction data collected by financial institutions offer a detailed look into the habits, patterns, travels, associations, and financial health of individuals.",1
"the risks associated with such surveillance of electronic transactions were recognized 50 years ago by paul armer of the rand corporation, who identified the risk in a 1968 us senate deposition (armer, 1968) and later argued that “if you wanted to build an unobtrusive system for surveillance, you couldn't do much better than an [electronic funds transfer system]” (armer, 1975). indeed, payment networks routinely share information about financial transactions with credit bureaus such as experian (steele, 2018), who are in the business of judging individuals by their behaviors and whose judgments form the basis of decisions made by lenders, insurers, and other clients of analytics companies (christl, 2017). additionally, documents released by edward snowden have revealed that the us national security agency has a division called “follow the money” (ftm) that systematically collects and analyses data from payment networks (spiegel, 2013).",1
"as a replacement for the “legitimate” currencies underwritten by the full faith and credit of sovereign governments, cryptocurrencies are far from perfect. there are structural reasons for this, including:",1
"1. absence of financial services. there is a notable absence of reliable organizations that offer routine financial services such as lending, and more importantly, there is a lack of regulatory support for crytpocurrencies. further, in contrast to transactions conducted via global messaging systems such as swift (society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication, 2018), there is generally no way to correct or unwind erroneous transactions performed with permissionless cryptocurrencies, a critical operational limitation. for cryptocurrencies to be a true substitute for government-issued currencies, they must support a range of marketplaces and financial products.",1
"2. absence of regulated marketplaces. history tells us that unregulated marketplaces for financial products can be harmful to ordinary citizens and businesses alike; consider for example the misbehavior of brokers and market participants that led to the creation of the us securities and exchange commission (durr and kinnane, 2018). cryptocurrency markets lack such controls and mechanisms to ensure accountability, and unchecked market manipulation is commonplace (tam, 2017; williams-grut, 2017).",1
"3. absence of legal context. there is no generally applicable mechanism for adjudicating disputes arising from transactions that are executed in cryptocurrency. when automatically executable contracts such as those that underpinned the “decentralized autonomous organization” that roiled the ethereum community in 2016 (williams-grut, 2017) are exploited, there is little legal recourse for hapless victims. although “certain operational clauses in legal contracts” may be automated to beneficial effect (isda, 2017), it would seem that a maximalist conception of the principle of “code is law” may not be workable without a suitable legal framework.",1

"modern retail banking involves electronic transactions between accounts, each of which represents a bilateral relationship between a financial institution (e.g., a bank) and another entity, perhaps an individual. institutions are generally regulated by governments. individuals and businesses may agree to exchange value (for example, in return for goods and services), but in reality the transaction takes place between institutions, which mutually agree to modify the state of the accounts such that the account of the “receiver” is incremented and the account of the “sender” is decremented correspondingly. record of the transactions and their results are generally visible to the institutions, accountholders, authorities, and auditors. figure 1 offers an illustration of the data flows corresponding to two transactions. institutions are direct participants in the transactions. both the accounts and the transactions may be monitored, i.e. “external” observers such as authorities (and in some cases others, such as unprivileged employees of the institutions and hackers) are able to examine the records of the transactions, their results, and the transactions themselves. since the set of regulated institutions is small, it is efficient for an observer to collect, aggregate, and analyse the data associated with substantially all of the transactions that take place within the system.",1
"figure 1. schematic representation of modern retail banking transaction flows. the buildings with columns represent financial institutions with which the transacting parties hold accounts. money is exchanged in state-issued currency, as represented by the pound sterling symbols. authorities and other powerful actors can monitor both the institutions and the flows, as represented by the magnifying glasses.",1
"cryptocurrencies offer an alternative payment mechanism that avoids some aspects of the surveillance infrastructure that characterizes institutionally-mediated retail bank transactions. modern cryptocurrencies generally take the form of bearer instruments, in the sense that their units are each represented by a public key on a public ledger and controlled by the knowledge of the matching private key. users are not required to establish accounts or furnish identification information of any sort to receive, possess, or spend cryptocurrency. this is not to say that accounts do not exist; most users of popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum establish accounts with centralized wallet providers such as blockchain.info or myetherwallet (chepurnoy, 2017). providers of accounts could be compromised or subverted by state actors or other powerful groups with an interest in surveillance. some account platforms cooperate with national regulators (united states securities and exchange commission, 2018), and some national regulators have declared that they will limit the scope of the rules that would apply to such platforms (higgins, 2016). many if not most cryptocurrency transactions are done by speculators, not those who intend to use cryptocurrency for its fundamental properties (russo, 2018), so even if most traders in practice might be indifferent to strong identity requirements crafted by regulators to satisfy aml goals, such rules undermine a key design objective of cryptocurrencies themselves.",1
"in principle, however, users of cryptocurrencies are not required to register with platforms, and they may possess cryptocurrency tokens on their own devices. figure 2 shows how this works in practice. assuming that cryptocurrency users take precautions not to reveal their identities whilst transacting, for example by using anonymity systems such as dingledine et al. (2004), they might expect to avoid identity-based blacklisting when they receive tokens. however, depending upon the system design, adversaries may still be able to monitor the flows. because successive bitcoin transactions are linkable to each other, those able to monitor the network can determine successive transactions associated with specific tokens and ultimately deanonymize bitcoin users (meiklejohn et al., 2013; tasca et al., 2016; al jawaheri et al., 2018).",1
"figure 2. schematic representation of bitcoin transaction flows. transacting parties can store value on their own devices, represented as piggy banks. the flows can be monitored by anyone.",1
"the fact that individual tokens can be traced means that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin may not be entirely fungible, in the sense of being “easy to exchange or trade for something else of the same type and value” (cambridge english dictionary, 2017), as an individual might be less willing to accept certain specific cryptocurrency tokens because doing so might implicitly link that individual to previous owners of the tokens. traceability has created demand for newly-minted or “clean” tokens that are harder to link to the previous owners or (ultimately) the previous transactions of the current owner (osborne, 2016), and the proposed blacklists of cryptocurrency addresses associated with suspicious operators could further exacerbate this distinction (hinkes and ciccolo, 2018). to avoid this problem, a cryptocurrency implementation would need to offer assurance that a transaction by an asset holder would generally not, directly or indirectly, result in that asset holder being linked to other transactions that had taken place previously. additionally, cryptocurrencies that make use of immutable ledgers and do not protect against traceability may for that reason be non-compliant with data protection regulations such as gdpr that specify a “right to be forgotten” (maxwell and salmon, 2017).",1
"some cryptocurrencies, most notably zcash and monero, are explicitly designed to address traceability concerns (sedgwick, 2018). monero in particular takes an approach that incorporates several security mechanisms, including:",1
"1. ring signatures, which allow signed messages to be attributable to “a set of possible signers without revealing which member actually produced the signature” (rivest et al., 2001).",0
"2. stealth addresses, which refer to methods for key management in which public keys are derived separately from private keys for the purpose of obscuring the public keys (courtois and mercer, 2017), and",0
"3. confidential transactions, which use pedersen commitment schemes pedersen (1991) to restrict disclosing the amounts transacted to anyone other than the transacting parties (van wirdum, 2016).",0
"table 2 shows how the existing payment methods achieve the desiderata listed in section 1. (none of the popular cryptocurrencies are known to offer totally unlinkable transactions, continual improvements notwithstanding). can we achieve a compromise that does better than the prevailing methods for electronic payments?",0
"figure 4 illustrates how institutions would join existing cryptocurrency systems as full participants. the motivation for broker-dealers and other institutions to participate is well-established; financial services related to cryptocurrencies are in demand by hedge funds and other clients (hankin, 2018; verhage et al., 2018). of course, this implies that broker-dealers would likely undertake activities related to unregulated markets and marketplaces (i.e., the cryptocurrencies themselves), and presumably the governance of the cryptocurrencies would not be under institutional control. that said, the distributed ledger underlying the cryptocurrencies would ensure that there would be an audit trail of all transactions, even if the details of those transactions might be inscrutable to authorities, auditors, or others without the active participation of the transacting parties.",1
"to facilitate monitoring, auditing, and taxation, we assume that regulators would stipulate that all cryptocurrency transactions undertaken by certain legal entities other than individual persons, such as registered corporations, licensed businesses, charities, trusts, and some partnerships, must take place via regulated institutional intermediaries such as banks, custodians, or broker-dealers. in general, such legal entities are already subject to various forms of government oversight, for example tax reporting requirements, so to introduce additional requirements and enforceability for cryptocurrency transactions is not unfathomable. the institutions would carry out aml/kyc compliance procedures as they currently do, and regulators would require that all cryptocurrency disbursements from such registered corporations or organizations, including dividends, interest, proceeds from disposal of cryptocurrency-denominated assets, and payments, including without limitation payments to suppliers, service providers, employees, and contractors, would take the form of remittances to other institutional accounts that hold cryptocurrency.",1
"individuals and non-business partnerships would not be subject to the same requirements and would be permitted to transact and hold cryptocurrency privately, as they do in many countries today. figure 5 shows how this would work in practice. businesses would maintain accounts with institutions and could direct the institutions to remit payments to other institutionally held accounts, including those whose beneficial owners are individuals, and individuals could in turn direct their institutional accounts to remit payments to their private cryptocurrency storage, which might or might not be hosted by a wallet provider. individuals could then remit payments from their own private storage to regulated businesses, such as merchants, private organizations, or service providers, without necessarily revealing their identities or a link to previous transactions such as those from which they received the cryptocurrency in the first place; figure 6 offers an illustration. given that the legal entities covered in the last paragraph are typically subject to financial reporting requirements, for example to quantify reimbursements or to reconcile changes in assets with income, we assert that it would be no easier for a business to deputize an individual to conduct cryptocurrency transactions on its behalf than it would for a business to deputize an individual to conduct any other financially meaningful aspect of its business.",1
"dividing the different ways of holding the cryptocurrency into two categories based upon whether or not it is held via accounts associated with regulated institutions may be considered analogous to dividing zcash into “t” (transparent) and “z” (shielded) addresses (peterson, 2016).",1
"because all cryptocurrency accounts held by corporations and registered businesses would be subject to monitoring by regulated institutions, the infrastructure would ensure that the taxable income of such corporations and businesses would be known. because all payments from corporations and registered businesses must be remitted to other institutional accounts, the infrastructure would ensure that the income of their shareholders, suppliers, service providers, and employees would be known and attributable to the correct legal entities. authorities would realize other benefits as well. the distributed ledger maintained by the cryptocurrency node operators would be observable by regulators and other authorities and cross-referenced against any cash flow statements of businesses engaged in cryptocurrency transactions. private transactions suspected of criminal activity could be verified by investigators with the cooperation of one of the counterparties, even if the investigation might not necessarily reveal identifying details of the other counterparty.",1
"our second approach starts with the assumption that the “public” cryptocurrencies are not suitable for all kinds of institutional support, perhaps for the reasons cited in section 3.1. instead, it proposes to establish a distributed ledger for conducting financial transactions, and that each node of the distributed ledger would be owned and operated by a regulated institution, as shown in figure 8. this could be achieved with a “permissioned” distributed ledger system such as hyperledger (2018), using an energy-efficient byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm such as pbft (castro and liskov, 1999). users and governments would benefit from the fact that transacting parties would not need to use cryptocurrency of dubious value but in fact could transact using digital versions of state-issued currency, i.e., central bank digital currency (cbdc), which is currently under consideration by central banks around the world and may offer a variety of economic and operational benefits (bank for international settlements, 2018).",1
figure 8. schematic representation of institutionally mediated private value exchange: nodes. the distributed ledger is operated by a federation of regulated institutions.,0
"at this point it might be tempting to suggest that since the entire network consists of regulated or otherwise approved financial institutions, then governments should require the establishment of a “master key” or other exceptional access mechanism, so that they might be able to break the anonymity of users. we argue that this temptation should be resisted. over the years, policymakers have called for broadly applied exceptional access mechanisms in a variety of contexts, and after considerable debate, such calls have been found to be premature and subsequently withdrawn (abelson et al., 1997, 2015; benaloh, 2018). indeed, legislators in the united states (congress of the united states, 2018) and france (thomson, 2016) have gathered opposition to exceptional access mechanisms, citing their intrinsic security weaknesses and potential for abuse.",1
"it is assumed that authorities would take the same measures described in section 3.1 to ensure that corporations and registered businesses use known, monitorable accounts for all of their transactions. enforcement of such a policy would be qualitatively easier in this case since the entire network is owned and operated by regulated institutions, and regulators could expect the same benefits associated with monitoring taxable income and reconciling line items in cash flow statements against actual, auditable transfers on the distributed ledger.",0
"figure 9. schematic representation of institutionally mediated private value exchange: private transactions. as in figure 5, an individual receives funds into her institutional account (second icon from left) and transfers them to her private store (second icon from right). unlike in figure 5, the funds may be state-issued currency, as indicated by the pound sterling symbols, rather than cryptocurrency. when she wants to make a payment, she must remit it from her private store to an account held by a regulated institution (rightmost icon).",1
"by ensuring that no single enterprise receives too large a share of any individual's transactions in the system, the use of a distributed ledger achieves an essential requirement of the design. individuals would be expected to use their private stores to transact with many different counterparties, via their own regulated intermediaries, so no single intermediary would have a global, “panopticon-like” view of all of the individual's transactions.",0
"since individuals cannot transact directly via their private stores, to exchange value they must transact via a regulated intermediary as shown in figure 10. individuals conducting transactions might not need to have accounts to exchange value with each other; we surmise that the regulated intermediary would perform the service for a fee. we also suggest that the intermediary would not be required to carry out strong identification of the sort required by the fatf recommendations (financial action task force, 2018) but might require a less-stringent form of identification, such as an attribute-backed credential indicating that either the sender or the receiver are eligible to transact (camenisch et al., 2013). regulated intermediaries could also provide token mixing services for groups of individuals who satisfy aml criteria, without explicitly requiring knowledge of their unitary identities.",1

"but you underestimate today’s mathematicians and cryptographers at your peril. i give you zerocoin, a way to perform genuinely anonymous cryptocurrency transactions. it was intended as an extension to bitcoin, but is also fully workable as a separate and independent “zerocoin” cryptocurrency.",1
"how is this possible? the concept is elegantly simple: zerocoins are drawn from a collective escrow pool which is defined, notated, and maintained on the host currency’s blockchain, and each coin’s transaction history is erased when it emerges from the pool. transactions are verified by means of  zero-knowledge proofs: a mathematical means to prove a truth without having to reveal any further verifying information. (for further details see this superb illustrated primer by matthew green, one of zerocoin’s creators, or the original zerocoin paper.)",0
it’s more than just a fascinating concept,0
"meanwhile, the zerocoin people have expanded their initial proposal into an even more anonymized protocol, called zerocash. zerocash is not entirely trustless; it has to be initially set up by a trusted entity. thereafter, though, its blockchain would allow transactions that did not contain any public information about their sender or receiver or amount — but all of these things can still be verified using zero-knowledge proofs. (indeed, “such proofs are less than 300 bytes long and can be verified in only a few milliseconds.” they are memorably known as zk-snarks, for “zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge.”)",1
"…but let’s not get too excited. let’s throw a little cold water on these fever dreams. there are hundreds of would-be bitcoin successors out there, and every one has failed to supplant the king of the heap. bitcoin’s tech may seem increasingly obsolete (only five years in!) but its network effects seem to make it unassailable. despite all the catcalls and lamentations of the last year, a single bitcoin is still worth more than $200. that is beyond remarkable. like wikipedia, bitcoin may not work in theory, but it’s nearly unstoppable in practice; and no other cryptocurrency will topple it from its perch any time soon.",0
"that’s why pegged sidechains are important. i’ve written about them before; basically, they’re a way to exchange bitcoins across an interwoven braid of many blockchains, and thus extend the protocol without having to somehow overthrow bitcoin’s primacy. (blockstream, the startup behind sidechains, recently raised $21 million, and counts among its founders several core bitcoin developers.)",1
"the vision of the moneta project is to help significantly advance bitcoin technology as a sidechain. as a sidechain, we want to help people realize that it’s possible to make bitcoin lightning-fast, far more private, and far more scalable. for example, people often think that bitcoin is limited to 7 transactions per second and can never compete with visa. with some changes to the protocol, we can increase that number one-hundred fold. also, with increased scalability comes decreased transaction fees. think of all the new marketplaces and behaviors that can arise if we can decrease bitcoin’s transaction fees from the magnitude of cents to the magnitude of hundredths of a cent … we hope to convey that bitcoin’s underlying protocol can in fact be advanced significantly — not just marginal improvements, but 10x or 100x improvements.",0

"""even with big data analysis, the ability to farm anything out of the metadata is cryptographically negligible,"" says spagni. in future implementations, he notes that monero will add the anonymity software i2p to mask not only users' transactions on the monero blockchain, but also the internet traffic underlying those transactions.",1
"that strict secrecy also helps explain monero's darknet popularity. after alphabay and a smaller dark web black market, known as oasis, integrated the cryptocurrency last summer, its value immediately increased around six-fold. alphabay told bitcoin magazine last month that the currency now accounts for about two percent of its sales. that's a small fraction, but still likely amounts to millions of dollars in annual revenue, given alphabay's dominant position in the dark web drug market and estimates of that market's total size and growth.",1
"despite the currency's sudden spike in price, spagni denies that he or any of the other core monero coders are sitting on a massive pile of wealth. ""we're just working on this to see where it goes,"" he says. but the promise and peril of monero, of course, is that no one can check that claim. the stashes of the monero developers, like those of its growing base of users, will stay secret by design.",1

"we have received numerous inquiries from fintech businesses and their legal counsel relating to icos/itos. with the offerings that we have reviewed to date, we have in many instances found that the coins/tokens in question constitute securities for the purposes of securities laws, including because they are investment contracts. in arriving at this conclusion, we have considered the relevant case law,{6} which requires an assessment of the economic realities of a transaction and a purposive interpretation with the objective of investor protection in mind.",1

"the purpose of this article is to analyze the effect that halving has on the fair market value of bitcoins. the main hypothesis of the study is that the decline in the cost of miners’ remuneration for mining is a significant factor that affects the price of cryptocurrencies. the article examines the factors that regulate the issuing process. the significance of a limited supply of bitcoin is detailed in the article, as well as the mechanism for the implementation of the issue of new bitcoins. the study compares the historical inflation data of the us dollar and the projected data on the inflation of bitcoin. the article analyzes the main technical element of cryptocurrency – halving – when the miner’s reward is halved. this analysis includes the mathematical methods of statistical data processing. research results show that reducing remuneration by half every four years leads to an increased market value of the cryptocurrency. this relationship is clearly illustrated by the kendall rank correlation method. the results of the study can have a significant impact on the fundamental assessment of bitcoin and can also enable investors to assess any of the existing and operating cryptocurrencies according to this method.",1
"in an attempt to examine the influence of inflation on the growth prospects of the nigerian economy, the study employs the autoregressive distributed lag on the selected variables, i.e. real gross domestic product (gdp), inflation rate, interest rate, exchange rate, degree of economy`s openness, money supply, and government consumption expenditures for the period 1980–2018. the study findings indicate that inflation and real exchange rate exert a significant negative impact on economic growth, while interest rate and money supply indicate a positive and significant impact on economic growth. other variables in the model depict no influence on the economic growth of nigeria. the causality result shows the unidirectional relationships between interest rate, exchange rate, government consumption expenditures and gross domestic product. however, inflation and the degree of openness show no causal relationship with gross domestic product. as a result, the study recommends that a more pragmatic effort is needed by the monetary authorities to target the inflation vigorously to prevent its adverse effect by ensuring a tolerable rate that would stimulate the economic growth of nigeria.",0

"the emergence of bitcoin in 2009 has received considerable attention surrounding the validity of cryptocurrencies as a viable and, in some jurisdictions, a legal currency alternative. despite widespread concern that these cryptocurrencies are fostering the environment within which a substantial bubble can occur, it is important to analyze whether these new assets are behaving similarly to major international currencies. this paper investigates the effects of international monetary policy changes on bitcoin returns using a garch (1.1) estimation model. the results indicate that monetary policy decisions based on interest rates taken by the federal open market committee in the united states significantly impact upon bitcoin returns. after controlling for international effects, we find significant evidence of volatility effects driven by united states, european union, united kingdom and japanese quantitative easing announcements. these results show that, despite its nature and ideals, bitcoin seems to be subject to the same economic factors as traditional fiat currencies, and is not entirely unaffected by government policies. this result has implications for investors using bitcoin as a hedging or diversification tool. in addition, we contribute to the existing debate regarding the classification of bitcoin as an asset class, by illustrating that bitcoin volatility exhibits various reactions that bear resemblance to both currency pairs and store-of-value assets.",1

"the platform, called alt 401(k), will allow workers in participating companies to transfer up to 5% of their account balances into a coinbase-traded cryptocurrency window. they will have over 50 cryptocurrencies to choose from as investment vehicles. forusall says it also plans to monitor allocations, alerting employees when their overall cryptocurrency allocation exceeds 5% of their portfolio.",1

"it may be too early to tell whether this is an industry-wide turning point or one-off phenomenon. forusall manages 401(k) plans for just 400 employer clients, representing $1.7 billion in retirement-plan assets. that’s a small slice of the $22 trillion market.",1

"for those with an uncertain understanding of its history, bitcoin entered the world on jan. 3, 2009, when a shadowy hacker — or team of hackers — working under the name satoshi nakamoto released an ingenious string of computer code that established a system permitting people to transfer money to one another online, directly, anonymously and outside government control, in much the way that napster once allowed the unrestrained transfer of music files. in a 500-word essay that accompanied the code, nakamoto suggested that the motive for creating bitcoin was anger at the financial crisis: “the root problem with conventional currencies is all the trust that’s required to make it work. the central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.”",1
"“price is the least interesting thing about bitcoin,” said roger ver, an early investor who is often called, in a typical movement phrase, the bitcoin jesus. “at first, almost everyone who got involved did so for philosophical reasons. we saw bitcoin as a great idea, as a way to separate money from the state.”",0

"there are even those who see bitcoin as the ultimate alternative to the global banking system. ryan singer, a co-founder of the bitcoin exchange tradehill, based in san francisco, compared the currency to email, conjecturing that it would gradually supplant traditional banking, just as digital messaging displaced handwritten letters. “when kids wake up to the fact that they don’t need their parents’ help to create a bitcoin wallet,” mr. singer said, “when they can use bitcoins for free international transactions, at any hour, in every major city on the planet, then you’ll know that something has changed.”",1
"perhaps the best proof of bitcoin’s ideological underpinnings is that a schism has emerged in recent weeks between moderate elements in the movement who sense the necessity of cooperating with officialdom, and a more uncompromising faction that wants to keep bitcoin free from any government regulation. the hard-line bloc is exemplified by the crypto-anarchist developers of a bitcoin product called dark wallet, which is scheduled to be introduced next year and will include extra protections to ensure that bitcoin transactions remain secure, anonymous and difficult to trace.",1

"the other day my barber asked me whether he should put all his money in bitcoin. and the truth is that if he’d bought bitcoin, say, a year ago he’d be feeling pretty good right now. on the other hand, dutch speculators who bought tulip bulbs in 1635 also felt pretty good for a while, until tulip prices collapsed in early 1637.",1
so is bitcoin a giant bubble that will end in grief? yes. but it’s a bubble wrapped in techno-mysticism inside a cocoon of libertarian ideology. and there’s something to be learned about the times we live in by peeling away that wrapping.,1
"if you’ve been living in a cave and haven’t heard of bitcoin, it’s the biggest, best-known example of a “cryptocurrency”: an asset that has no physical existence, consisting of nothing but a digital record stored on computers. what makes cryptocurrencies different from ordinary bank accounts, which are also nothing but digital records, is that they don’t reside in the servers of any particular financial institution. instead, a bitcoin’s existence is documented by records distributed in many places.",1
"and your ownership isn’t verified by proving (and hence revealing) your identity. instead, ownership of a bitcoin is verified by possession of a secret password, which — using techniques derived from cryptography, the art of writing or solving codes — lets you access that virtual coin without revealing any information you don’t choose to.",1
"like bitcoins, $100 bills aren’t much use for ordinary transactions: most shops won’t accept them. but “benjamins” are popular with thieves, drug dealers and tax evaders. and while most of us can go years without seeing a $100 bill, there are a lot of those bills out there — more than a trillion dollars’ worth, accounting for 78 percent of the value of u.s. currency in circulation.",1
"so are bitcoins a superior alternative to $100 bills, allowing you to make secret transactions without lugging around suitcases full of cash? not really, because they lack one crucial feature: a tether to reality.",1
"bitcoin, by contrast, has no intrinsic value at all. combine that lack of a tether to reality with the very limited extent to which bitcoin is used for anything, and you have an asset whose price is almost purely speculative, and hence incredibly volatile. bitcoins lost about 40 percent of their value over the past six weeks; if bitcoin were an actual currency, that would be the equivalent of a roughly 8,000 percent annual inflation rate.",1
"oh, and bitcoin’s untethered nature also makes it highly susceptible to market manipulation. back in 2013 fraudulent activities by a single trader appear to have caused a sevenfold increase in bitcoin’s price. who’s driving the price now? nobody knows. some observers think north korea may be involved.",1
"but what about the fact that those who did buy bitcoin early have made huge amounts of money? well, people who invested with bernie madoff also made lots of money, or at least seemed to, for a long time.",1
"as robert shiller, the world’s leading bubble expert, points out, asset bubbles are like “naturally occurring ponzi schemes.” early investors in a bubble make a lot of money as new investors are drawn in, and those profits pull in even more people. the process can go on for years before something — a reality check, or simply exhaustion of the pool of potential marks — brings the party to a sudden, painful end.",0
"when it comes to cryptocurrencies there’s an additional factor: it’s a bubble, but it’s also something of a cult, whose initiates are given to paranoid fantasies about evil governments stealing all their money (as opposed to private hackers, who have stolen a remarkably high proportion of extant cryptocurrency tokens). journalists who write skeptically about bitcoin tell me that no other subject generates as much hate mail.",1
"“when we say bitcoin, we mean the idea: the birth of cryptocurrency. we know it’s not perfect. but we’re not after perfection, we’re after progression. we’re after a way out. and we will not stop.",1
"we have been brought to a point where it has become necessary to dissolve the bond between currency and institution. we are not required to declare the causes which impel us to push for the separation, but we will oblige.",0
"do not underestimate dna; nothing is born completely neutral. follow the protocol: it has anarchistic implications. bitcoin is inherently anti-establishment, anti-system, and anti-state. bitcoin undermines governments and disrupts institutions because bitcoin is fundamentally humanitarian. there’s an elimination of 3rd party intrusion. it’s purely peer-to-peer. the blockchain is free speech. it’s decentralized, voluntary, and non-aggressive. bitcoin is not supposed to work within our current mechanisms. bitcoin needs not entities of authority to acknowledge it, incorporate it, regulate it, and tax it. bitcoin does not pander to power structures, it undermines them.",0
"bitcoin means to channel economic power directly through the individual. this is reflected by satoshi’s symbolic birthday, which falls on the same day that roosevelt signed the 6102 executive order, which forbade the hoarding of gold. we repeat. bitcoin is not intended to be integrated; it’s intended to be a ghost outside the machine.",1
the voices of the people who are working to preserve the purity of bitcoin’s ethos are being drowned out. but actions speak louder than words. bitcoin is utility. the cypherpunks are building anonymous systems. the crypto-anarchists are making institutions arbitrary. the internet is anarchy. and cryptocurrencies are the printless fingers of the internet.,1
"bitcoin is not just a currency, a commodity, or a convenience. just like the internet gave information back to the people, bitcoin will give financial freedom back to the people. but that’s only the first step. there will be a shift in the structure of enterprise, in the way we interact, in the way we voice our opinions, and in the way we fuel our action. bitcoin will allow us to shape the world without having to ask for permission. we declare bitcoin’s independence. bitcoin is sovereignty. bitcoin is renaissance. bitcoin is ours. bitcoin is.”",1
"sander duivestein (1971) is a highly acclaimed and top-rated trendwatcher, an influential author, an acclaimed keynote speaker, a digital business entrepreneur, and a strategic advisor on disruptive innovations. his main focus is the impact of new technologies on people, businesses and society.",0
"this book is a very readable and valuable monograph which combines sound historical research with insightful analysis.  the issues discussed go far beyond bitcoin and are directly related to broader internet governance issues, such as those presented in three important books by, respectively, mcchesney, schiller and powers and jablonsky.",0
"golumbia’s book starts by jumping right into its main thesis: that a specific recent technology (blockchain) is being touted as an enabler of a libertarian revolution, not just by naïve technologists, but by determined and well organized extremist right-wing groups that attack existing governmental institutions, including central banks and conventional monetary systems.",1
"it proceeds to show how that ideology is related to the so-called cyber-libertarian ideology that holds that governments should not regulate the internet: any required regulation will be developed and enforced by those that provide and use the internet.  and it proceeds to show how, in practice, that ideology equates to regulation imposed on users by private companies that are accountable to nobody because they hold dominant positions in their specific markets (e.g. the terms and conditions imposed by companies such as facebook and google).  as the author puts the matter, citing ames (p. 10): “big tech’s larger political goals are in alignment with the old extraction industry’s: undermining the countervailing power of government and public politics to weaken its ability to impede their growing dominance over their portions of the economy, and to tax their obscene stores of cash.  google—like facebook, like koch industries—wants a government that’s strong enough to enforce its dominant private power over the economy and citizens and protect its wealth, but too broken and too alienated from the public to adequately represent the public interest against their domineering monopolistic power.”",1
"the book includes a good summary of right-wing criticism of central banks and existing monetary systems, an overview of the history and technology of bitcoin, and a comparison of bitcoin rhetoric with extreme right-wing criticism of the us federal bank.  it explains the difference between “currency” and “money”: money is not just a means of exchange, it is also a store of value and a unit of account (measure of value).  and it shows how bitcoin is not a store of value (the value of a single bitcoin fluctuates wildly) nor a unit of account.  consequently, according to the author, it is highly unlikely that bitcoin would replace current monetary systems, and it is likely that future use of bitcoin might be primarily by those who cannot use current monetary systems for legal and regulatory reasons.  that is, bitcoin might be used by smugglers, blackmailers (e.g. perpetrators of ransomware), and other types of criminals; not to mention speculators and manipulators who make money off of bitcoin itself.",1
"the book concludes by discussing blockchains, the technology that underpins bitcoin, and concludes that, as for bitcoin, the promised development of applications and services based on blockchains (p.38): “on the surface … seem structured around promises that appeal to and reinforce rightist political ideologies.”  the author concludes that (p. 40):“the whole point of the enterprise, as with most of the efforts promoted by libertarians and anarcho-capitalists, is to enable a wide range of extractive and exploitative business practices, and thus to increase the power of corporations and capital outside the scope of any attempts by democratic polities to constrain them.”",1
"it is revealing to cite a comment posted on the amazon web site for the book: “this article is a statist critique of bitcoin and its ideological (anti-statist or libertarian) background.  which would be fine, except the author does not realize that statism is also an ideology, and thus does not understand the anti-statist position either.”",1
"the author of that comment appears to equate the two ideologies, without taking into account the fact that state institutions are very real, and pervasive, and have been so for millennia, whereas the anti-statist ideology is a utopia that has rarely been implemented on any significant scale.",0
"in fact, the private companies that are touted by right wing libertarians as the ultimate arbiters of most everything are thoroughly hierarchical, autocratic, top-down, organizations that embody the antithesis of anarchism and individual freedom.",0
"as the book says, proponents of the demise of the state want the state when it suits them, namely to protect private property, intellectual property, etc., but not when it does not suit them, namely to protect users, consumers, and workers.  this is corporate violence, which, if it continues unchecked, will surely be worse than the state violence decried by right-wing libertarians.",0

"washington — stephen k. bannon, 10 months removed from the job of chief strategist to president trump and five months after his ouster from the arch-conservative news site breitbart news, is betting that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can disrupt banking the way mr. trump disrupted american politics.",1
mr. bannon won’t reveal very much about his cryptocurrency plans — he worries that the controversy that comes with his name could have a bad impact on projects just getting off the ground.,1
"but he has had private meetings with cryptocurrency investors and hedge funds where he has discussed working on so-called initial coin offerings through his investment business, bannon & company. and in his first interview on the topic, he said he had a “good stake” in bitcoin.",1
"in a small gathering of academics at harvard university this spring, he even floated the possibility of creating a new virtual currency, the “deplorables coin.” the name is a nod to hillary clinton’s description of mr. trump’s supporters as “a basket of deplorables.”",1
the work that mr. bannon is doing in the virtual currency realm is still in its early stages. but he has expressed an interest in helping entrepreneurs and even countries looking to create their own cryptocurrencies — generally outside the united states.,1
"the offbeat world of cryptocurrencies has drawn interest from all sorts over the last few years, from drug dealers and scam artists to the biggest companies in silicon valley and the most staid institutions of wall street.",1
"it is not a shocking place for mr. bannon, 64, to plot his re-emergence. cryptocurrencies have many of the characteristics that drew him into tea party politics: they break old rules, they exist on the periphery and they pose a challenge to the powerful figures and institutions that have long called the shots.",1
"“it’s disruptive populism,” mr. bannon said in the interview at his capitol hill townhouse in washington. “it takes control back from central authorities. it’s revolutionary.”",0
"even though he has no formal ties to the business anymore, mr. bannon still refers to his townhouse as the breitbart embassy, the nickname given to it because so much of the site’s business was done there.",0
"while breitbart editors and writers no longer linger at all hours inside the embassy, remnants of the website remain in breitbart mementos hanging from the wall and coffee mugs with the signature block b logo strewn about the kitchen. mr. bannon still accepts a steady stream of visitors who provide him intelligence and gossip from the conservative circles he once commanded. but these days he is just as likely to be convening meetings there on his new financial venture.",0
"there’s bitcoin. there’s litecoin. there’s ethereum. so just what is cryptocurrency, and how does it work? essentially, it’s digital money that’s bought and sold online. there’s no bills or coins. it’s not based on another asset like gold. and it doesn’t go through traditional financial institutions like banks. instead, these currencies operate in a completely decentralized system that uses so-called blockchain technology to track transactions. to see how this works, let’s look at how you’d buy something with cryptocurrency. say that alice wants to buy a bike from dan using bitcoin, her cryptocurrency of choice. alice begins by logging into her bitcoin wallet with a private key, a unique combination of letters and numbers. with a traditional financial transaction, the exchanges get sent to banks on each side who record the money being subtracted from one account and added to another. but remember, in this scenario, there are no banks or middlemen. instead, alice’s transaction is shared with everyone in the bitcoin network. these networked computers add alice’s transaction to a shared list of recent transactions, known as a block. every 10 minutes, the newest block of transactions is added on, or chained, to all the previous blocks. that’s how you get a blockchain. to ensure that each block of transactions on the chain is verified, a subset of bitcoin’s network joins a race to solve a difficult math puzzle. and if they solve it first, their record of the block of transactions becomes the official record. they’re rewarded with bitcoins of their own, and the network gets a new block on the chain. this entire process is known as mining. but instead of chipping away at rock, you’re solving complex puzzles. the fact that many computers are competing to verify a block ensures that no single computer can monopolize the bitcoin market. to ensure the competition stays fair and evenly timed, the puzzle becomes harder when more computers join in. the bitcoin protocol says mining will continue until there are 21 million bitcoins in existence. that’s set to happen around 2140 — if bitcoin lasts that long.",1
he won’t talk about a possible return to politics someday. his messy rupture with the white house over critical comments he made in michael wolff’s book “fire and fury” about colleagues and donald trump jr. is still too fresh. but he does see a political component to virtual currency.,1
"“it was pretty obvious to me that unless you got somehow control over your currency, all these political movements were going to be beholden to who controlled the currency,” mr. bannon said.",1
his vision for virtual currency has elements of his unorthodox ideology. he sounds like both an avowed libertarian who wants government out of his life and a progressive who wants wall street held to account when he insists that virtual currencies can help citizens take back power from the central banks that “debase your currency” and make citizens “slaves to debt.”,1
"new companies have raised billions through these i.c.o.s, which allow them to bypass regulators and other middlemen and go straight to investors. that has also led to plenty of scams, and authorities throughout the world are starting to crack down.",1
mr. bannon’s involvement in cryptocurrencies has raised eyebrows among people trying to move the business toward the mainstream. they fear he will further cement the technology’s reputation as a plaything of fringe elements.,1
"“it almost seems like a natural progression for a man who gained prominence by shoveling out unfounded conspiracies to now shilling complex technology and financial instruments to an unsophisticated investing public,” said colin platt, a cryptocurrency researcher and adviser.",1
bitcoin are stored and moved around a global network of computers that allows for the system to work without relying on a central authority. that lack of oversight has made bitcoin a favorite method of payment for online drug markets and ransom schemes.,1
"bitcoin has been popular with the alt-right and nationalist communities because it has provided them with a way to receive online donations and evade restrictions put on them by banks and payment companies. paypal and apple pay, for example, shut down the accounts of some right-wing groups last year.",1
"cryptocurrencies are also gaining mainstream interest. goldman sachs, where mr. bannon worked in the 1980s, recently said it was creating a bitcoin trading operation. the parent company of the new york stock exchange has been looking at building an exchange for digital tokens. and facebook has put top executives on a project exploring use of the technology.",1
"these big companies are generally trying to take the technology away from its radical political roots. but mr. bannon is hoping to embrace those roots. “control of the currency,” he said, “is control of everything.”",0
"timothy lewis, a hedge fund manager who met with mr. bannon to talk about cryptocurrencies last month, said he was impressed with the degree to which mr. bannon had delved into the details of the technology and the challenges it faces.",1
"mr. bannon is particularly interested in the possibility that countries could create coins tied to national wealth — an italian coin tied to marble deposits in the country, for instance.",0
"he found his way into the virtual currency universe through brock pierce, a former child actor who appeared in films like “the mighty ducks” before starting a company in hong kong that sold the virtual gold that players use in the video game world of warcraft.",0
"the company, internet gaming entertainment, or ige, brought on mr. bannon as vice chairman in 2005 to help mr. pierce expand the business and deal with legal threats.",0
"mr. bannon credits the company with introducing him to the ranks of disaffected young men who gathered online around video games, and who became pillars of the alt-right movement.",0
"since leaving ige in 2007, mr. pierce has become involved with a wide array of virtual currency projects, including an effort to create a cryptocurrency enclave in puerto rico that takes advantage of the island’s low taxes, and a new virtual currency known as eos, which has raised over $3 billion.",1
"mr. pierce’s big claims for cryptocurrencies — and a recent turn toward new age spiritualism — have made him a target for critics. john oliver, on his hbo comedy show, recently held up mr. pierce as an emblem of the bombast that floats around the virtual currency community. after the segment, the company that created eos said mr. pierce had left the company.",1

"sector with the aim to ensure that the eu embraces the digital revolution and drives it with innovative european firms in the lead, making the benefits of digital finance available to european consumers and businesses. in addition to this proposal, the package also includes a proposal for a pilot regime on distributed ledger technology (dlt) market infrastructures",0
"one of the strategy’s identified priority areas is ensuring that the eu financial services regulatory framework is innovation-friendly and does not pose obstacles to the application of new technologies. this proposal, together with the proposal on a dlt pilot regime, represents the first concrete action within this area.",1
", in march 2018, the commission has been examining the opportunities and challenges raised by crypto-assets. following a big surge in the market capitalisation of crypto-assets during 2017, in december 2017, executive vice-president dombrovskis, in a letter addressed to the european banking authority (eba) and the european securities and markets authority (esma), urged them to reiterate their warnings to investors. in the 2018 fintech action plan, the commission mandated the eba and esma to assess the applicability and suitability of the existing eu financial services regulatory framework to crypto-assets. the advice",1
", issued in january 2019, argued that while some crypto-assets could fall within the scope of eu legislation, effectively applying it to these assets is not always straightforward. moreover, the advice noted that provisions in existing eu legislation may inhibit the use of dlt. at the same time, the eba and esma underlined that – beyond eu legislation aimed at combating money laundering and terrorism financing – most crypto-assets fall outside the scope of eu financial services legislation and therefore are not subject to provisions on consumer and investor protection and market integrity, among others, although they give rise to these risks. in addition, a number of member states have recently legislated on issues related to crypto-assets leading to market fragmentation.",1
a relatively new subset of crypto-assets – the so-called ‘stablecoins’ – has recently emerged and attracted the attention of both the public and regulators around the world. while the crypto-asset market remains modest in size and does not currently pose a threat to financial stability,1
", this may change with the advent of ‘global stablecoins’, which  seek wider adoption by incorporating features aimed at stabilising their value and by exploiting the network effects stemming from the firms promoting these assets",1
“a common approach with member states on cryptocurrencies to ensure we understand how to make the most of the opportunities they create and address the new risks they may pose”,1
"to respond to all of these issues and create an eu framework that both enables markets in crypto-assets as well as the tokenisation of traditional financial assets and wider use of dlt in financial services, this regulation will be accompanied by other legislative proposals: the commission is also proposing",1
"this proposal, which covers crypto-assets falling outside existing eu financial services legislation, as well as e-money tokens, has four general and related objectives. the first objective is one of legal certainty. for crypto-asset markets to develop within the eu, there is a need for a sound legal framework, clearly defining the regulatory treatment of all crypto-assets that are not covered by existing financial services legislation. the second objective is to support innovation. to promote the development of crypto-assets and the wider use of dlt, it is necessary to put in place a safe and proportionate framework to support innovation and fair competition. the third objective is to instil appropriate levels of consumer and investor protection and market integrity given that crypto-assets not covered by existing financial services legislation present many of the same risks as more familiar financial instruments. the fourth objective is to ensure financial stability. crypto-assets are continuously evolving. while some have a quite limited scope and use, others, such as the emerging category of ‘stablecoins’, have the potential to become widely accepted and potentially systemic. this proposal includes safeguards to address potential risks to financial stability and orderly monetary policy that could arise from ‘stablecoins’.",1
"this proposal is part of a broader framework on crypto-assets and distributed ledger technology (dlt), as it is accompanied by proposals ensuring that existing legislation does not present obstacles to the uptake of new technologies while still reaching the relevant regulatory objectives.",1
"the proposal builds on extensive and long-standing market monitoring and participation in international policy work, for example, in such fora as the financial stability board, the financial action task force and the g7.",1
", the commission mandated the european supervisory authorities (esas) to produce advice on the applicability and suitability of the existing eu financial services regulatory framework on crypto-assets. this proposal builds on the advice received from the eba and esma.",1
"it is crucial for europe to reap all the benefits of the digital age and to strengthen its industrial and innovation capacity within safe and ethical boundaries. in addition, the mission letter provided to executive vice-president dombrovskis calls for a common approach with member states on cryptocurrencies to ensure europe can make the most of the opportunities they create and address the new risks they may pose.",1
"this proposal is closely linked with wider commission policies on blockchain technology, since crypto-assets, as the main application of blockchain technologies, are inextricably linked to the promotion of blockchain technology throughout europe. this proposal supports a holistic approach to blockchain and dlt, which aims at positioning europe at the forefront of blockchain innovation and uptake. policy work in this area has included the creation of the european blockchain observatory and forum, and the european blockchain partnership, which unites all member states at political level, as well as the public-private partnerships envisaged with the international association for trusted blockchain applications.",1
"this proposal is also consistent with the union policies aimed at creating a capital markets union (cmu). it notably responds to the high-level forum’s final report, which stressed the underused potential of crypto-assets and called on the commission to bring legal certainty and establish clear rules for the use of crypto-assets.",1
"this proposal is consistent with the sme strategy adopted on 10 march 2020, which also highlights dlt and crypto-assets as innovations that can enable smes to engage directly with investors.",1
"finally, the proposal is fully in line with the recommendation in the security union strategy for the development of a legislative framework in crypto-assets given the growing effect of these new technologies on how financial assets are issued, exchanged, shared and accessed.",1
"the proposal is based on article 114 tfeu, which confers on the european institutions the competence to lay down appropriate provisions for the approximation of laws of the member states that have as their objective the establishment and functioning of the internal market. the proposal aims to remove obstacles to establishment and improve the functioning of the internal market for financial services by ensuring that the applicable rules are fully harmonised.",1
"today, crypto-asset issuers and service providers cannot fully reap the benefits of the internal market, due to a lack of both legal certainty about the regulatory treatment of crypto-assets as well as the absence of a dedicated and coherent regulatory and supervisory regime at eu level. while a few member states have already implemented a bespoke regime to cover some crypto-asset service providers or parts of their activity, in most member states they operate outside any regulatory regime. in addition, an increasing number of member states are considering bespoke national frameworks to cater specifically for crypto-assets and crypto-asset service providers.",1
"the divergent frameworks, rules and interpretations of both crypto-assets and crypto-asset services throughout the union hinder the service providers’ ability to scale up their activity at eu level. this means that service providers of these inherently cross-border products and services are forced to familiarise themselves with several member states’ legislations, obtain multiple national authorisations or registrations and comply with often divergent national laws, sometimes adjusting their business model throughout the union. this results in high costs, legal complexity and uncertainty for service providers operating in the crypto-assets space, limiting the development and scaling up of crypto-asset activities in the union. additionally, the lack of applicable regimes to crypto-asset service providers in many member states limits the availability of funding and sometimes even wider access to necessary financial services, such as banking services, due to the regulatory uncertainty associated with crypto-assets and therefore crypto-asset service providers.",1
"these divergences also create an uneven playing field for crypto-asset service providers depending on their location, creating further barriers to the smooth functioning of the internal market. finally, this adds to the lack of legal certainty, which, combined with the absence of a common eu framework, leaves consumers and investors exposed to substantial risks.",1
"member states makes cross-border provision of services in relation to crypto-assets difficult. proliferation of national approaches also poses risks to level playing field in the single market in terms of consumer and investor protection, market integrity and competition. furthermore, while some risks are mitigated in the member states that have introduced bespoke regimes on crypto-assets, consumers, investors and market participants in other member states remain unprotected against some of the most significant risks posed by crypto-assets (e.g. fraud, cyber-attacks, market manipulation).",1
"action at eu level, such as this proposal for a regulation, would create an environment in which a larger cross-border market for crypto-assets and crypto-asset service providers could develop, thereby reaping the full benefits of the internal market. an eu framework would significantly reduce the complexity as well as the financial and administrative burdens for all stakeholders, such as service providers, issuers and consumers and investors. harmonising operational requirements for service providers as well as the disclosure requirements imposed on issuers could also bring clear benefits in terms of consumer and investor protection and financial stability.",1
"under the principle of proportionality, the content and form of eu action should not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the treaties. the proposed rules will not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives of the proposal. they will cover only the aspects that member states cannot achieve on their own and where the administrative burden and costs are commensurate with the specific and general objectives to be achieved.",0
"the proposed regulation will ensure proportionality by design, differentiating clearly between each type of services and activities in accordance with the associated risks, so that the applicable administrative burden is commensurate with the risks involved. notably, the requirements set out in this regulation are proportionate to the limited associated risks, given the relatively small market size to date. at the same time, the proposal imposes more stringent requirements on ‘stablecoins’, which are more likely to grow quickly in scale and possibly result in higher levels of risk to investors, counterparties and the financial system.",1
"article 114 tfeu allows the adoption of acts in the form of a regulation or directive. for this proposal, a regulation was chosen in order to lay down a single set of immediately applicable rules throughout the single market.",1
"the proposed regulation establishes harmonised requirements for issuers that seek to offer their crypto-assets across the union and crypto-asset service providers wishing to apply for an authorisation to provide their services in the single market. these issuers and service providers must not be subject to specific national rules. therefore, a regulation is more appropriate than a directive.",1
"the commission services consulted member state experts in the expert group on banking, payments and insurance (egbpi) on two occasions (18 may 2020 and 16 july 2020)",0
"the commission services held a dedicated webinar on an eu framework for crypto- assets, as part of the digital finance outreach 2020 (“dfo”) series of events (19 may 2020)",1
"the purpose of the public consultation was to inform the commission on the development of a potential eu framework for crypto-assets. it covered both questions on crypto-assets not covered by the existing eu financial services legislation, crypto-assets covered by the existing eu financial services legislation (e.g. qualifying as transferable securities or electronic money/e-money), specific questions on so-called ‘stablecoins’ as well as more general questions on the application of dlt in financial services.",1
"most respondents stressed that the creation of a bespoke regime for crypto-assets not currently covered by the eu financial services legislation, including non-regulated ‘stablecoins’, would be beneficial for the establishment of a sustainable crypto-asset ecosystem in the eu. the majority of respondents confirmed that there is a need for legal certainty and harmonisation across national legislations, and many stakeholders were in favour of the bulk of the exemplified requirements that could be set for crypto-asset service providers.",1
"member state representatives in the egbpi expressed overall support for the approach chosen, to create an appropriate bespoke regulatory framework for unregulated crypto-assets. they highlighted the need to avoid regulatory arbitrage, avoid circumvention of rules by crypto-asset issuers, and to ensure that all relevant rules from existing legislation on payments and e-money is also present in a bespoke regime for the so-called ‘stablecoins’. the need to provide a redemption right for ‘stablecoins’ was also mentioned whilst there were differing opinions about the preferred solution in relation to supervision.",1
"as part of a series of outreach events, the commission hosted a webinar specifically on crypto-assets. a wide range of industry stakeholders and public authorities participated in the webinar, providing additional input from the sector on the interaction with the financial services legislation.",1
"the proposal also builds on and integrates feedback received through meetings with stakeholders and eu authorities. most stakeholders, including crypto-asset service providers, have been overall supportive, underlining once again that the sector is very much looking for legal certainty in order to develop further.",1
"in preparing this proposal, the commission has relied on qualitative and quantitative evidence collected from recognised sources, including the two reports from the eba and esma. this has been complemented with publicly available reports from supervisory authorities, international standard setting bodies and leading research institutes, as well as quantitative and qualitative input from identified stakeholders across the global financial sector.",1

"the rsb recommended improvements in some areas with a view to: (i) put the initiative in the context of ongoing eu and international regulatory efforts; (ii) provide more clarity as to how the initiative will mitigate the risks of fraud, hacking and market abuse and also explain the coherence with the upcoming revision of the anti-money laundering legislation; and (iii) explain better the financial stability concerns relating to ‘stablecoins’ and clarify how supervisory bodies will ensure investor and consumer protection. the impact assessment has been amended accordingly, also addressing the more detailed comments made by the rsb.",1
"first, the commission considered two policy options for developing a crypto-asset framework for crypto-assets not covered by existing eu financial services legislation (except ‘stablecoins’ for which a different set of options was considered – see below):",1
"under option 1, issuers and service providers that opt in to the eu regime would benefit from an eu passport to expand their activities across borders. service providers, which decide not to opt in, would remain unregulated or would be subject to national bespoke regimes without being granted the eu passport.",0
"under option 2, all issuers (except those making small offerings) and service providers would be subject to eu law and would benefit from an eu passport. the national bespoke regimes on crypto-assets would no longer be applicable.",1
"while option 1 could be less burdensome for small issuers and service providers that can decide not to opt in, option 2 would ensure a higher level of legal certainty, investor protection, market integrity and financial stability, and would reduce market fragmentation across the single market. full harmonisation represents a more coherent approach compared to an opt-in regime. therefore, option 2 was the preferred option.",1
"in addition, the commission also assessed specific options for the so-called ‘stablecoins’ where these would also be considered crypto-assets not covered by existing eu financial services legislation:",1
"by following a strict risk-based approach and building on recommendations currently being developed by, for example, the fsb, this option would address vulnerabilities to financial stability posed by stablecoins, while allowing for the development of different types of ‘stablecoin’ business models. these would include specific disclosure requirements for ‘stablecoin’ issuers as well as requirements imposed on the reserve backing the ‘stablecoin’.",1
"‘stablecoins’ whose value is backed by one single currency that is legal tender are close to the definition of e-money under the electronic money directive. the aim of many ‘stablecoins’ is to create a “means of payments” and, when backed by a reserve of assets, some ‘stablecoins’ could become a credible means of exchange and store of value. in that sense, ‘stablecoins’ can arguably have common features with e-money. however, this option would require ‘stablecoin’ issuers to comply with existing legislation that may not be fit for purpose. although the electronic money directive and, by extension the payment services directive, could cover some ‘stablecoin’ service providers, it might not mitigate adequately the most significant risks to consumer protection, for example, those raised by wallet providers. in addition, the electronic money directive does not set specific provisions for an entity that would be systemic, which is what ‘global stablecoins’ could potentially become.",1
"this approach could potentially be justified, as the risks posed by ‘stablecoins’ and in particular those that could reach global scale (including risks to financial stability, monetary policy and monetary sovereignty) would exceed the benefits offered to eu consumers in terms of fast, cheap, efficient and inclusive means of payment. however, option 3 would not only create costs for ‘stablecoins’ already in operation, but it would also prevent the reaping of any benefits related to this new type of crypto-assets. option 3 would not be consistent with the objectives set at eu level to promote innovation in the financial sector. furthermore, option 3 could leave some financial stability risks unaddressed, should eu consumers widely use ‘stablecoins’ issued in third countries.",1
"the commission considered that option 1 was the preferred option for ‘stablecoins’ in combination with option 2, to avoid regulatory arbitrage between ‘stablecoins’ that are indistinguishable from e-money and the treatment of e-money issued on a distributed ledger. together with option 2 (",1
", in particular financial stability risks. the structure of ‘stablecoins’ is complex and comprises many interdependent functions and legal entities. the regulatory approach under option 1 (in combination with option 2 for hitherto unregulated crypto-assets) would cover the different functions usually present in ‘stablecoin’ structures (governance body, asset management, payment and customer-interface functions) and would also capture those interactions between entities that can amplify the risk to financial stability.",1
") with mandatory disclosure requirements. in order to avoid the creation of administrative burden, small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) will be exempted from the publication of such an information document where the total consideration of the offering of crypto-assets is less than €1,000,000 over a period of 12 months. issuers of ‘stablecoins’ will not be subject to authorisation by a national competent authority (nca) if the outstanding amount of ’stablecoins’ is below €5,000,000. furthermore, the requirements imposed on crypto-asset service providers are proportionate to the risks created by the services provided.",1
"this proposal holds implications in terms of costs and administrative burden for ncas, the eba and esma. the magnitude and distribution of these costs will depend on the precise requirements placed on crypto-asset issuers and service providers and the related supervisory and monitoring tasks.",1
"the estimated supervisory costs for each member state (including staff, training, it infrastructure and dedicated investigative tools) can range from €350.000 to €500.000 per year, with one-off costs estimated at €140.000. however, this would be partially offset by the supervisory fees that ncas would levy on crypto-asset service providers and issuers.",1
"for the eba, it will require over time a total of 18 full-time employees (fte) to take on the supervision of issuers of significant asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens. the eba will also incur additional it costs, mission expenses for the on-site inspections and translation costs. however, all of these costs would be fully covered by the fees levied on the issuers of significant asset-referenced tokens and issuers of significant e-money tokens.",0
"for esma, the estimated costs of establishing a register of all crypto-asset service providers and maintaining this with the information received from ncas and the eba is to be covered within their operating budget.",1
providing for a robust monitoring and evaluation mechanism is crucial to ensure that the regulatory actions undertaken are effective in achieving their respective objectives. the commission has therefore established a programme for monitoring the outputs and impacts of this regulation. the commission will be in charge of monitoring the effects of the preferred policy options on the basis of the non-exhaustive list of indicators indicated in the impact assessment (p.64-65). the commission will also be in charge of assessing the impact of this regulation and will be tasked with preparing a report to the council and parliament (article 122 of the proposal).,0
"this proposal seeks to provide legal certainty for crypto-assets not covered by existing eu financial services legislation and establish uniform rules for crypto-asset service providers and issuers at eu level. the proposed regulation will replace existing national frameworks applicable to crypto-assets not covered by existing eu financial services legislation and also establish specific rules for so-called ‘stablecoins’, including when these are e-money. the proposed regulation is divided into nine titles.",1
"title i sets the subject matter, the scope and the definitions. article 1 sets out that the regulation applies to crypto-asset service providers and issuers, and establishes uniform requirements for transparency and disclosure in relation to issuance, operation, organisation and governance of crypto-asset service providers, as well as establishes consumer protection rules and measures to prevent market abuse. article 2 limits the scope of the regulation to crypto-assets that do not qualify as financial instruments, deposits or structured deposits under eu financial services legislation. article 3 sets out the terms and definitions that are used for the purposes of this regulation, including ‘crypto-asset’, ‘issuer of crypto-assets’, ‘asset-referenced token’ (often described as ‘stablecoin’), ‘e-money token’ (often described as ‘stablecoin’), ‘crypto-asset service provider’, ‘utility token’ and others. article 3 also defines the various crypto-asset services. importantly, the commission may adopt delegated acts to specify some technical elements of the definitions, to adjust them to market and technological developments.",1
"title ii regulates the offerings and marketing to the public of crypto-assets other than asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens. it indicates that an issuer shall be entitled to offer such crypto-assets to the public in the union or seek an admission to trading on a trading platform for such crypto-assets if it complies with the requirements of article 4, such as the obligation to be established in the form of a legal person or the obligation to draw up a",1

"some crypto-assets qualify as financial instruments as defined in article 4(1), point (15), of directive 2014/65/eu of the european parliament and of the council",1
". the majority of crypto-assets, however, fall outside of the scope of union legislation on financial services. there are no rules for services related to crypto-assets, including for the operation of trading platforms for crypto-assets, the service of exchanging crypto-assets against fiat currency or other crypto-assets, or the custody of crypto-assets. the lack of such rules leaves holders of crypto-assets exposed to risks, in particular in areas not covered by consumer protection rules. the lack of such rules can also lead to substantial risks to market integrity in the secondary market of crypto-assets, including market manipulation. to address those risks, some member states have put in place specific rules for all – or a subset of – crypto-assets that fall outside union legislation on financial services. other member states are considering to legislate in this area.",1
"the lack of an overall union framework for crypto-assets can lead to a lack of users’ confidence in those assets, which will hinder the development of a market in those assets and can lead to missed opportunities in terms of innovative digital services, alternative payment instruments or new funding sources for union companies. in addition, companies using crypto-assets will have no legal certainty on how their crypto-assets will be treated in the different member states, which will undermine their efforts to use crypto-assets for digital innovation. the lack of an overall union framework on crypto-assets could also lead to regulatory fragmentation, which will distort competition in the single market, make it more difficult for crypto-asset service providers to scale up their activities on a cross-border basis and will give rise to regulatory arbitrage. the crypto-asset market is still modest in size and does not yet pose a threat to financial stability. it is, however, likely that a subset of crypto-assets  which aim to stabilise their price by linking their value to a specific asset or a basket of assets could be widely adopted by consumers. such a development could raise additional challenges to financial stability, monetary policy transmission or monetary sovereignty.",1
"a dedicated and harmonised framework is therefore necessary at union level to provide specific rules for crypto-assets and related activities and services and to clarify the applicable legal framework. such harmonised framework should also cover services related to crypto-assets where these services are not yet covered by union legislation on financial services. such a framework should support innovation and fair competition, while ensuring a high level of consumer protection and market integrity in crypto-asset markets. a clear framework should enable crypto-asset service providers to scale up their business on a cross-border basis and should facilitate their access to banking services to run their activities smoothly. it should also ensure financial stability and address monetary policy risks that could arise from crypto-assets that aim at stabilising their price by referencing a currency, an asset or a basket of such. while increasing consumer protection, market integrity and financial stability through the regulation of offers to the public of crypto-assets or services related to such crypto-assets, a union framework on markets in crypto-assets should not regulate the underlying technology and should allow for the use of both permissionless and permission-based distributed ledgers.",1
"union legislation on financial services should not favour one particular technology. crypto-assets that qualify as ‘financial instruments’ as defined in article 4(1), point (15), of directive 2014/65/eu should therefore remain regulated under the general existing union legislation, including directive 2014/65/eu, regardless of the technology used for their issuance or their transfer.",1
"crypto-assets issued by central banks acting in their monetary authority capacity or by other public authorities should not be subject to the union framework covering crypto-assets, and neither should services related to crypto-assets that are provided by such central banks or other public authorities.",1
"any legislation adopted in the field of crypto-assets should be specific, future-proof and be able to keep pace with innovation and technological developments. ‘crypto-assets’ and ‘distributed ledger technology’ should therefore be defined as widely as possible to capture all types of crypto-assets which currently fall outside the scope of union legislation on financial services. such legislation should also contribute to the objective of combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism. any definition of ‘crypto-assets’ should therefore correspond to the definition of ‘virtual assets’ set out in the recommendations of the financial action task force (fatf)",1
". for the same reason, any list of crypto-asset services should also encompass virtual asset services that are likely to raise money-laundering concerns and that are identified as such by the fatf.",1
"a distinction should be made between three sub-categories of crypto-assets, which should be subject to more specific requirements. the first sub-category consists of",1
"a type of crypto-asset which is intended to provide digital access to a good or service, available on dlt, and that is only accepted by the issuer of that token",1
"should be considered as a specific type of crypto-assets. a second sub-category of crypto-assets are ‘asset-referenced tokens’. such asset-referenced tokens aim at maintaining a stable value by referencing several currencies that are legal tender, one or several commodities, one or several crypto-assets, or a basket of such assets. by stabilising their value, those asset-referenced tokens often aim at being used by their holders as a means of payment to buy goods and services and as a store of value. a third sub-category of crypto-assets are crypto-assets that are intended primarily as a means of payment aim at stabilising their value by referencing only one fiat currency. the function of such crypto-assets is very similar to the function of electronic money, as defined in in article 2, point 2, of directive 2009/110/ec of the european parliament and of the council",1
". like electronic money, such crypto-assets are electronic surrogates for coins and banknotes and are used for making payments. these crypto-assets are defined as ‘electronic money tokens’ or ‘e-money tokens’.",1
"despite their similarities, electronic money and crypto-assets referencing a single fiat currency differ in some important aspects. holders of electronic money as defined in article 2, point 2, of directive 2009/110/ec are always provided with a claim on the electronic money institution and have a contractual right to redeem their electronic money at any moment against fiat currency that is legal tender at par value with that currency. by contrast, some of the crypto-assets referencing one fiat currency which is legal tender do not provide their holders with such a claim on the issuers of such assets and could fall outside the scope of directive 2009/110/ec. other crypto-asset referencing one fiat currency do not provide a claim at par with the currency they are referencing or limit the redemption period. the fact that holders of such crypto-assets do not have a claim on the issuers of such assets, or that such claim is not at par with the currency those crypto-assets are referencing, could undermine the confidence of users of those crypto-assets. to avoid circumvention of the rules laid down in directive 2009/110/ec, any definition of ‘e-money tokens’ should be as wide as possible to capture all the types of crypto-assets referencing one single fiat currency that is legal tender. to avoid regulatory arbitrage, strict conditions on the issuance of e-money tokens should be laid down, including the obligation for such e-money tokens to be issued either by a credit institution as defined in regulation (eu) no 575/2013 of the european parliament and of the council",1
"the european commission published its new digital finance strategy on 24 september 2020. one of its centrepieces is the draft regulation on markets in crypto-assets (mica), designed to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets in the eu. in our working paper ‘the markets in crypto-assets regulation (mica) and the eu digital finance strategy’ we analyse mica in the context of existing eu financial regulation.",1
"the new digital finance strategy (dfs) is part of a broader approach to the future development of digital finance and innovation in the eu, embodied in a new digital finance package. the new package comprises this new dfs and a renewed retail payments strategy in an effort to ‘boost europe’s competitiveness and innovation in the financial sector, paving the way for europe to become a global standard-setter.’ by pursuing enhanced consumer choice while at the same time ensuring consumer protection and financial stability, the commission ‘aims to boost responsible innovation in the eu’s financial sector, especially for highly innovative digital startups, while mitigating any potential risks related to investor protection, money laundering and cybercrime’.",1
"the new dfs provides a very broad and comprehensive framework for future reforms to further the development of digital finance in the eu. while some of its building blocks were sketched out in the eu commission’s fintech action plan of 2018, the dfs represents a major step forward. in particular, the dfs promises new proposals on prudential regulatory treatment of crypto-assets, on sme financing, and on the role of distributed ledger technology (dlt) and the internet of things (iot). it also provides support for a possible central bank digital currency (cbdc) from the european central bank (ecb), which was the subject of a separate ecb report published later the same week.",1
"mica is the eu’s response to the policy debate prompted by the libra proposal in june 2019. with it the eu commission has proposed bespoke regulation for utility tokens and stablecoins including payments tokens, asset-backed tokens and ‘significant’ stablecoins (including ‘global stablecoins’). as to investment and securities tokens, the eu dfs relies on the existing body of eu financial and securities law, with the prospectus regulation, the mifid framework and ucitsd and aifmd at its core, with the intention to incorporate necessary changes as part of existing ongoing amendment and review processes. mica provides for a bespoke prospectus regime for crypto-assets, while the issuing of e-money tokens (ie payment tokens), asset-referenced tokens (also known as stablecoins) and crypto-asset services would become regulated activities subject to licensing. supervision of crypto-asset service providers (casps) will rest with national authorities, whereas supervision of ‘significant’ asset-referenced and e-money tokens will rest mainly with the european banking authority. thus, with mica, the question of how the market for crypto-assets will be regulated under eu law is now answered.",1
"we find that the eu dfs marks a very important step for the eu in developing both innovation and the single market. mica is an ambitious legislative project that responds to an urgent policy need. yet the need was entirely different for ‘simple’ crypto-assets on the one hand, and payment tokens on the other hand.",1
"simple crypto-assets under mica will, in principle, be primarily utility tokens (perhaps with some monetary component), as other tokens will be subject to the existing body of eu law. for these other types of tokens, investor protection may warrant legislative intervention, with a strict application of existing eu financial law—and the definition of ‘financial instrument’, in particular—providing the alternative. while mica clearly fills any (perceived) gap, it fails to meet the second policy goal in the european single market: a harmonized application of eu financial law concepts across all eu and eea member states. the mica route is apparently easy, but its practical repercussions may well enrich lawyers and infuriate market participants for years. thus, we propose that guideline-issuing competence should be conferred upon esma (as the authority in charge of financial instruments) to ensure a harmonized application of eu financial law.",1
"the regulation of payment tokens, on the other hand, is well justified from a financial stability perspective given that a well-functioning payment infrastructure lies at the heart of all financial systems. in this regard, mica has indeed filled a gap, often by leaning on existing rules of the e-money directive. while this approach may be justified for small token offerings, it does not provide a suitable legal environment for truly large global stablecoins of global importance. we recommend the insertion of cooperation mechanisms similar to systemically important market infrastructures of international importance with regard to global stablecoins.",1
"more broadly, mica does not stand on its own but is part of an ambitious and comprehensive approach of the sort we view as essential. however, further substantial revision of its detailed provisions, in the ways outlined in our paper, will be necessary if mica is to achieve its various goals.",0

"in january, south korea also began enforcing a requirement that the name on cryptocurrency investors’ bank account match the name on their account at a cryptocurrency exchange in order to deposit money into their virtual wallets. with exchanges now required to ensure their customers have real name bank accounts, they are also required to partner with domestic banks to establish real name accounts for their clients.",1

the deadline is also pushing cryptocurrency exchanges to take action. the top exchanges in south korea have begun to delist or place warnings on virtual assets they deem to be risky. the step has also resulted in legal action. upbit’s decision to delist 24 cryptocurrencies has resulted in a series of lawsuits against the cryptocurrency exchange.,1

he said the idea was to build a bitcoin mining hub around the country's geothermal potential. he also said that el salvador would offer citizenship to people who showed evidence they had invested in at least three bitcoins.,1
"the use of bitcoin will be optional for individuals and would not bring risks to users, bukele said, with the government guaranteeing convertibility to dollars at the time of transaction through a $150 million trust created at the country's development bank bandesal.",1

reserve bank of india governor shaktikanta das recently said that the rbi has conveyed its “serious and major concerns” over virtual currencies (vcs) to the government. the so-called concerns over cryptocurrency are misplaced at best and smack of the central bank’s statist approach at worst.,1
"on march 4, 2020, a three-judge bench of the supreme court had quashed the ban that the rbi had imposed on trading in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in april 2018.",1
"on may 31 this year, the rbi had directed banks not to cite its 2018 ban as a reason to deny banking services to customers dealing in cryptocurrency. “it has come to our attention through media reports that certain banks/regulated entities have cautioned their customers against dealing in virtual currencies” by making a reference to the ban it had imposed, an rbi circular said.",1
"so, it took almost a year for the rbi to realize, and that too from media reports, that the entities regulated by it still regarded virtual currencies as proscribed. this is surely not a mark of the banking regulator’s efficiency.",1
"it directed the banks that following the apex court order, the earlier circular proscribing virtual currencies was no longer valid. the circular went on to add, “banks, as well as other entities addressed above, may, however, continue to carry out customer due diligence processes in line with regulations governing standards for know your customer (kyc), anti-money laundering (aml), combating of financing of terrorism (cft) and obligations of regulated entities under prevention of money laundering act, (pmla), 2002, in addition to ensuring compliance with relevant provisions under foreign exchange management act (fema) for overseas remittances.”",1
"banks continued to caution their customers against dealing in cryptocurrencies because the rbi, despite the sc verdict, has persistently campaigned against the innovation. in the last week of february this year, das raised concerns over vcs. the next month he again said the rbi had major concerns. then again in june. his opposition to cryptocurrency seems to be the zeal of an activist rather than the reservation of a statutory regulator regarding an issue.",1
"so, the rbi remains hostile towards and suspicious of cryptocurrencies, which are digitally encrypted, decentralized, and not regulated by any central bank or government. right from the beginning of cryptocurrencies in the 1980s, its votaries were anti-establishment activists whose distrust of central banks as well as governments was libertarian-like.",1
"as one of them, adam back, wrote: “what we want is fully anonymous, ultra-low transaction cost, transferable units of exchange. if we get that going … the banks will become the obsolete dinosaurs they deserve to become.”",0
"the parent of the first successful cryptocurrency, bitcoin, is a mysterious, unknown figure by the name of satoshi nakamoto. he is said to have sent an e-mail in august 2008 to adam back, along with an attachment, a white paper. according to satoshi, “the root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. the central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.”",1
"he and other cryptocurrency enthusiasts overcame the problem by bypassing all central banks and governments. bitcoin was born and became hugely successful, attracting billions of dollars in the last few years.",1
"yet, as evident from das’ recent salvo at virtual currencies, the central bank is unwilling to accept this development. this does not show him and the rbi in a good light; the central bank starts looking like a luddite, instinctively hostile to innovation. and like a control freak that can’t accept anything it can’t control (the government’s approach was similar to that of the rbi. it once planned a law to ban vcs). this is not much different from the chinese attitude. it may be noted that china proscribes vcs.",0
"on the other hand, many major democracies, such as the us, canada and the uk, allow the use of bitcoin. even the tiny latin american nation el salvador with a population of 6.5 million, recently accepted bitcoin as legal tender.",1
"it is not that the rbi has nothing important to do. “gross non-performing assets (gnpas) on retail and msme loan books of public sector banks rose to 7.28 per cent in june 2021 from about 6 per cent a year ago. the incidence of bad loans was lower for private banks with gnpas at 3.32 per cent in june, up from 2.01 per cent year ago, according to care ratings,” says a business standard report.",1
"another report in the indian express says, “public sector banks are experiencing a sharp surge in the proportion of mudra loans turning into non-performing assets (npas) following the impact of covid on incomes and repayment capacity of borrowers, according to bankers and an analysis of available data from state-level bankers’ committees.”",1
"then there is the issue of bank privatization, something urgently needed but, if it happens, will be hugely controversial. the good news is that finance minister nirmala sitharaman has made her government’s intentions clear over the subject. a couple of weeks ago, she said, “during the budget, a public enterprise policy was announced, wherein we had identified certain strategically important sectors and in them, the bare minimum presence of the government will be there. banks, financial institutions, and insurance are identified as strategic sectors, which means the government’s minimum presence will be there in insurance.”",0
"then there is a great deal that india has to do in the realm of financial inclusion. the recently unveiled rbi’s annual financial inclusion (fi) index shows the country at 53.9, where 100 is the full financial inclusion score. the rbi should focus on such urgent matters instead of crying like a bad loser on the issue of cryptocurrency.",1
the reserve bank of india (rbi) on may 31 asked banks not to cite its 2018 order as a reason to deny banking services to customers who dealt in cryptocurrencies. it stated that its 2018 order was set aside by the supreme court in march this year and that it would be inappropriate for banks to cite the order any longer.,1
"however, the central bank asked banks to continue other due diligence procedures on cryptocurrency traders under rules linked to anti-money laundering and prevention of terrorism.",1
"in april 2018, the rbi issued a circular instructing banks to make sure customers dealing in cryptocurrencies were not allowed access to banking services. the circular came after years of suspicion among rbi officials about the legitimacy of virtual currencies issued by private parties.",1
"the central bank has repeatedly warned about the supposed risks that these unregulated private currencies pose to investors and the financial system. the 2018 circular was seen by many as an attempt to discourage citizens from purchasing cryptocurrencies. by barring banks from facilitating transactions involving cryptocurrencies, the rbi effectively banned any significant rupee investment in cryptocurrencies.",1
"the supreme court in its judgment on internet and mobile association of india vs. rbi  in march overturned the rbi’s 2018 circular. the sc noted that in the absence of any legislative ban on the buying or selling of cryptocurrencies, the rbi cannot impose disproportionate restrictions on trading in these currencies. the court felt such restrictions would interfere with the fundamental right of citizens to carry out any trade that is deemed legitimate under the law.",1
"banks have been reluctant to let their customers deal in cryptocurrencies due to the uncertainty surrounding the legality. meanwhile, the centre is considering a proposal to impose an outright ban on cryptocurrencies. in 2017, it is worth noting, an inter-disciplinary committee set up by the centre had recommended a ban on the trading and possession of cryptocurrencies.",1
cryptocurrency sceptics say there is good reason to believe that governments around the world will eventually ban all cryptocurrencies. they argue that governments and their central banks will not allow the dilution of their monopoly power over money.,1
"the indian government has been giving conflicting signals on this matter. finance minister nirmala sitharaman in march said that there won’t be a total ban on the use of cryptocurrencies in the country. but the centre soon plans to introduce the cryptocurrency and regulation of official digital currency bill, 2021, which is said to contain provisions completely banning the use of all cryptocurrencies. the future of cryptocurrencies in india, thus, still hangs in the balance.",1

"the bill also proposes to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in india, with certain exceptions, to promote the underlying cryptocurrency technology and its uses. (reuters/file)",1
"from an outright ban on cryptocurrencies in 2016 to an upcoming bill for regulation—the government’s stance on digital assets has changed considerably over the past few years. the upcoming cryptocurrency and regulation of official digital currency bill, 2021 is different from the earlier one – ‘banning of cryptocurrency and regulation of official digital currency bill, 2019.’",1
"while the older law sought to impose a complete ban on all crypto-related activities including mining, buying, holding, selling, and dealing, the new one will look to make a clear distinction when it comes to its often used categorisation as a currency.",1
"currently, there is no regulation or any ban on the use of cryptocurrencies in the country. the reserve bank of india’s (rbi) order banning banks from supporting crypto transactions, was reversed by the supreme court order of march 2020.",1
"the cryptocurrency and regulation of official digital currency bill, 2021 is listed for introduction in parliament’s winter session seeks to prohibit all “private cryptocurrencies” in india. however, it allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses.",1
"in 2013, the reserve bank of india (rbi) issued a circular warning the public against the use of virtual currencies. the bank warned users, holders, and traders of virtual currencies about the potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection, and security-related risks they are exposing themselves to.",1
"the central bank pointed out that it has been keeping a close eye on developments in the virtual currency world, including bitcoins, litecoins, and other altcoins.",1
"but as banks continued to allow transactions on cryptocurrency exchanges — on february 1, 2017, rbi released another circular, reiterating its concerns with virtual coins. and by the end of 2017, a warning was issued by rbi and the finance ministry clarifying that virtual currencies are not a legal tender.",1
"at the same time, two public interest litigations (pils) were filed in the supreme court, one asking for a ban on buying and selling of cryptocurrencies in india, the other asking for them to be regulated. in november, the government formed a committee to study issues around virtual currencies and propose actions.",1
"in march 2018, the central board of digital tax (cbdt) submitted a draft scheme to the finance ministry for banning virtual currencies. a month later, the rbi issued a circular that restrained banks and financial institutions from providing financial services to virtual currency exchanges.",1
former rbi deputy governor bp kanungo and then central board of direct taxes (cbdt) chairman sushil chandra voiced their opinions in favour of a ban on cryptocurrencies. chandra said it creates “a chain of black money.” he also mentioned that searches conducted into exchanges dealing with virtual currencies had revealed that most uninformed people in interior places are being lured to buy it.,1
"on april 6, 2018, rbi issues a circular asking commercial and co-operative banks, payments banks, small finance banks, nbfcs, and payment system providers from dealing in virtual currencies, or providing services to all entities which deal with crypto exchanges.",1
"in april 2018, the finance ministry appointed-committee proposed a draft bill for the regulation of virtual currencies but did not recommend a ban. however, in february 2019 the committee proposed a fresh draft bill that recommended a blanket ban.",1
"meanwhile, in march 2020 a significant development took place. the supreme court of india lifted the curb on cryptocurrency imposed by rbi, which restricted banks and financial institutions from providing access to banking services to those engaged in transactions in crypto assets.",1
"“a high-level inter-ministerial committee (imc) constituted under the chairmanship of secretary (economic affairs) to study the issues related to virtual currencies and propose specific actions to be taken in the matter recommended in its report that all private cryptocurrencies, except any virtual currencies issued by the state, will be prohibited in india,” finance minister sitharaman said in rajya sabha on february 9.",1
minister of state for finance anurag thakur also informed parliament that the government planned to bring a bill on cryptocurrencies as the existing laws were deemed inadequate to deal with the issues concerning cryptocurrencies.,1
"further, a report revealed that india could propose a law banning cryptocurrencies, fining anyone trading in the country or even holding such digital assets, a senior government official told reuters at the time.",1
"days after the report surfaced, in an interview on march 5, sitharaman said she wants to foster innovation in crypto. “we want to make sure that there is a window available for all kinds of experiments which will have to take place in the crypto world,” she said during an interview on cnbc tv18. “we are not closing our minds.”",1
"further, in november 2021, the standing committee on finance, chaired by bjp member jayant sinha, met representatives of crypto exchanges, blockchain and crypto assets council (bacc), among others, and came to the conclusion that cryptocurrencies should not be banned, but regulated.",1
"earlier this month, prime minister narendra modi called a meeting on cryptocurrencies with senior officials. the indications are that strong regulatory steps will probably be taken to deal with the issue.",1
"meanwhile, the reserve bank of india has repeatedly underlined its strong view against cryptocurrencies, saying these pose a serious threat to the macroeconomic and financial stability of the country. it has also raised doubts on the number of investors trading on cryptocurrencies and their claimed market value.",1
"rbi governor shaktikanta das reiterated his opposition to cryptocurrencies, saying these pose a serious threat to any financial system since they are unregulated by central banks. the rbi announced its intent to come out with an official digital currency in the face of the proliferation of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, about which the central bank has had many concerns.",1
sitharaman tuesday termed cryptocurrency as a “risky area” while speaking in the rajya sabha. she said that they are yet to take a call on advertisements around cryptocurrency. the statement comes a day after she was quoted as saying in the lok sabha that there was no proposal to recognise bitcoin as a currency in the country.,1
"“this is a risky area and not in a complete regulatory framework. no decision was taken on banning its advertisements. steps are taken to create awareness through rbi and sebi. the government will soon introduce a bill,” sitharaman said during the question hour in rajya sabha.",1

"it is a mixed-bag of risk and rewards. savvy investors track technological advances to reap benefits. however, it is equally important to be educated and aware – as an economy, a crypto-exchange, a trader or a consumer – to build a broader ecosystem where innovation thrives, and threats are mitigated. cryptocurrencies gained acceptability, but they need to be seen as a double-edged sword in today’s volatile, risk-averse environment. for instance, there is a no central authority to regulate, take ownership or provide security to safeguard crypto assets.",1
"there is ease of use and making transactions on a real-time basis, with no cross-border restrictions. anonymity is offered, but there is virtually no know-your-customer (kyc) requirement, which makes it a concern from a traceability point of view. one of the major issues is that crypto accounts can be used for illicit purposes that are impossible to track. this makes it worrisome. creating a crypto wallet requires just an internet-enabled device. with limited information technology literacy, this can expose users to high-risk situations and make them potential targets for cyber criminals. the resurrection of cryptocurrencies will depend on how the ecosystem can grow while mitigating risks.",1

"the rbi is expected to come up with central bank digital currency (cbdc) a digital currency that can be transacted using platforms based on blockchains and would be regulated by rbi. however, this is just a form of digital currency, but the broader question is what should be a comprehensive policy related to cryptocurrency? mr. hemant batra a renowned public policy expert and a lawyer while speaking to mumbai uncensored has provided his detailed insight and expertise on the policy regarding cryptocurrency, he says, “public policy can be of two types, firstly, a policy which brings or initiates a reform in any sector or segment within the society and second, is a policy brought about to formalize a change which has already happened. the indian cryptocurrency market has now become very big with involvement of billions of dollars in the market hence, it is now unattainable and irreconcilable for the government to completely ban all sorts of cryptocurrency and its trading and investment. india is absolutely ready to accept cryptocurrency with a regulatory system based on global requirements as per the guidelines issued by imf (international monetary fund). banning cryptocurrency will lead to damaging the financial statistics of all nations”",1
"the next aspect is the challenges that cryptocurrency puts forth before the policy makers, these can be termed as “macro” consequence of cryptocurrency. first aspect is the challenge related to the monetary policy, former rbi governor duvvuri subbarao speaking at a public forum has expressed his concerns on cryptocurrency and its impact on monetary policy according to him, cryptocurrency may erode central bank’s control over money supply, “crypto is backed by algorithms and there is fear that the central bank might lose control over money supply and inflation management. there are also concerns that crypto will disrupt the monetary policy,” he said, “crypto can jump capital controls; fiat money is linked to the reserve currency,” his indication was towards “stablecoins” whose value is tied to a fiat currency by maintaining equivalent reserves (“currency board” exchange rate regime).",1
"the next challenge is fiscal, that is cryptocurrency being used as a tool for tax evasion as it would be very feasible for a crypto investor to invest his untaxed money in purchasing bitcoins and similar would be a case in money laundering wherein “proceeds of crime” could easily be invested in any of the cryptocurrency exchange and trading platforms. mr. batra on this point states, “fatf (financial action task force) and imf have expressed their serious concern about this issue, there are certain sets of cryptocurrency that are based on very private blockchains wherein one cannot identify the nation from which such virtual currency is operating and there are cases investigated globally wherein there has been a direct link between financing illegal and terror activities through crypto exchanges. to tackle this scenario, the government has to introduce regulatory regimes not on the cryptocurrency but crypto service providers.”",1
"the lockdown brought about a dramatic growth of e-commerce in the past few years, which has hampered the business of physical retailers.with super high class companies who have invested billions of dollars in research and development in india we have been going through the abuse of ‘aggregator superpower’ a monopolising model of e-commerce. allegations by cait and others have ranged from predatory pricing and prioritising certain sellers to the foreign ownership of amazon and flipkart.",1
"an attempt by the indian government is being made to break down giant monopolies like amazon, flip kart, swiggy and so on with the introduction of ondc which is supposed to be as revolutionary as upi itself. it will not just be limited to products but also to services such as mobility, grocery, food order and delivery, hotel booking and travel, and many others.",0
"ondc is an open technology network based on open protocol which is expected to digitise the entire value chain, standardise operations, promote inclusion of suppliers, derive efficiencies in logistics and enhance value for consumers.",0
"the official government note was circumspect. “ondc is a globally first-of-its-kind initiative that aims to democratise digital commerce, moving it from a platform-centric model to an open network,” it said. “[it] will enable buyers and sellers to be digitally visible and transact through an open network. no matter what platform or application they use.”",0
"e-commerce is a complex business where every business has its unique supply chain and processes and standardisation is a challenge. it would require reconfiguration, including a complete revamp of their systems and losing advantages like control over the user interface and consumer behaviour insights. for the government however it will provide better control over what is sold and bought. in upi, a recent government stipulation set a market share limit of 40 per cent for any service provider, which immediately dampens the growth of a market leader phonepe which is owned by walmart outside india.",1
"in a marketplace-centric model, a buyer first selects a platform and then searches for a product there where then platform acts as an intermediary for the buyer and seller. in the new model, the buyer will search for the product first and then pick the right seller offering that item. the platform the seller is on becomes secondary. it aims at promoting open networks developed on open-sourced methodology, using open specifications and open network protocols independent of any specific platform. this provides all the small and medium fishes in the ocean with an opportunity to grow big, and simultaneously give a boost to make in india.",1
"“it’s (open network for digital commerce) an idea whose time has come. we owe it to the millions of small sellers to show an easy way to participate in the new high-growth area of digital commerce,” nilekani, the co-founder and non-executive chairman of infosys, himself supported this platform.",0
"more than three years after the prevention of cruelty to animals (pet shop) rules, 2018, making it mandatory for pet shops to be registered with the respective state animal welfare board (sawb) companies still go one to flout laws.",1
"on june 13, 2021 corporation officials said they are now keeping a close eye on the pet trade and are ready to seize the shops if the owners do not get valid registration and trade licences.",0
"as per the prevention of cruelty to animals (pet shop) rules, 2018, no person should sell or trade in pet animals, whether retail or wholesale, or establish operate a pet shop, or any other establishment engaged in sale, purchase or exchange of pets without obtaining a certificate of registration from the state animal welfare board (awb).",1
"on 26th august 2021 the petitioner’s counsel sanjukta dey told the bench that she had visited shops in crawford market and kurla as recently as three days ago and found violations of the earlier high court order, which had directed immediate closure of such illegal shops. the shops require permission from the state animal welfare board and they had seen puppies being drugged and animals kept out in the sun or out in the rain with no food or water. due to the continued lack of regulation, illegal pet shops have mushroomed all over the city. it is alleged that such establishments are keeping animals domesticated as well as wildlife from india and abroad in “utterly unhygienic conditions” and the life and liberty of thousands of animals are at stake as they languish and die in miserable conditions in unlicensed and unregulated pet shops. they are also often taken away from mothers a a young age.",1

"bitcoin just received a strong vote of confidence from an unlikely source, a former acting director of the central intelligence agency. in so doing, he put senior government officials who issue public warnings about bitcoin’s alleged use by criminals, such as treasury secretary janet yellen, on notice.",1
"michael morell, a 33-year veteran of the agency, published an independent paper commissioned by the newly formed lobbying group crypto council for innovation (whose founding members include coinbase, fidelity digital assets, and square) directly refuting this well-traveled narrative. in an expansive study, morell came to two key conclusions:",0
"but that is not all. in speaking with forbes before the paper’s release, morell made it clear that there will also be severe geopolitical repercussions for the u.s. vis-a-vis china if it wastes energy and resources chasing a ghost as opposed to leveraging blockchain, and fintech more generally, to build the country’s technological and economic base. specifically, he said that “we need to make sure that the conventional wisdom that is wrong about the illicit use of bitcoin doesn't hold us back from pushing forward the technological changes that are going to allow us to keep pace with china.”",0
"michael j. morrell testifies before a house permanent select committee on intelligence hearing on capitol hill in washington, wednesday, april 2, 2014 (ap photo/manuel balce ceneta)",0
"when he began this study, morell would be the first to tell you that he did not expect to reach these conclusions. in our discussion, he said that one of his key assumptions was that people like secretary yellen and christine lagarde, president of the european central bank, were some of the most informed people on the planet and that their perspectives were grounded in facts. however, in doing his analysis he discovered “just the opposite, that [bitcoin and crypto] weren't rife with illicit activity. in fact, there was probably less illicit activity in the bitcoin ecosystem than there is in the traditional banking system.”",1
"so, what did he find? simply put, the percentage of illicit transactions in crypto is minimal (less than 1% according to one report from chainalysis), and falling. for additional context, he notes that estimates of illicit activity conducted through traditional intermediaries range between 2-4 percent of global gdp.",1
"these findings will not surprise readers who have been following this industry for a long time and have encountered this narrative before, but they have never been refuted so directly by such an authoritative figure.",0
"but that is not all. perhaps even more interesting to morell was how analytic firms such as chainalysis, ciphertrace, and elliptic can employ forensic and artificial intelligence tools to find illicit actors and activity on blockchains. in fact, he said that he was “literally blown away by how they find illicit activity...this is great intelligence work.”",0
he also made sure to point out that this analysis works on multiple levels because it can be used to track the actions of known actors as well as identify previously unknown people of interest.,0
"but all of that said, morell was clear that given the relatively low prevalence of illicit transactions in crypto, care should be taken to ensure that forensic work and law enforcement/intelligence does not override the need for the us to keep pace with china with regard to financial innovation. in fact, he fears that the u.s., which is already going at a glacial pace with regards to the development of a digital dollar, will slow down even further if it becomes overly concerned about this issue.",1
"of course, much remains to be worked out between now and then. for instance, it is unclear whether or not sovereign digital currencies will run on top of blockchains, especially decentralized platforms such as bitcoin, ethereum, etc. it seems likely that they will operate in more tightly controlled environments, at least for initial launches.",1
"that said, there are natural gravitational pulls towards globalization, which lends itself to decentralization (nobody actually controls the internet), so morell’s broader point is worth taking.",0

"posing as members of the public, investigators discovered roughly 30,000 cryptocurrency-related domain names in recent weeks, most of which were registered in the past year as the price of bitcoin soared past $19,000. many of the alleged scams use fake addresses, slick marketing materials and promises of over 4 percent daily interest, regulators said. a few have even used unauthorized photos of high-profile individuals, such as supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg, to portray themselves as aboveboard.",1
"other sites have used images of prince charles and actor jennifer aniston, but identified them under different names, to provide testimonials, the regulators said.",1
"after receiving the cease-and-desist letters warning of illegal activity, the targets of the investigations typically have up to a month to file a response, depending on the jurisdiction, borg said. some states allow for a hearing before the state securities commission, and an appeal to a court or administrative law judge. regulators could also take the schemes to court. but regulators expect many sites to shut down voluntarily or amend their practices to comply with securities laws.",0

"down nearly 40% year to date, bitcoin, the cryptocurrency market's chief barometer, continued its decline relative to the u.s. dollar heading into early april. while a few bullish hints are on the horizon, further consolidation appears likely as investors look to ""de-risk"" in other markets that affect cryptocurrency prices. why the recent weakness?",1

"a classic trade war has unfolded between the united states and other countries as the trump administration added tariffs on steel (25%) and aluminum (10%) in march and the people's republic of china responded with tariffs of up to 25% on pork, wine, fruit, and nuts in a menu of 128 affected u.s. exports.",1
"while president trump has offered up a myriad of rationales behind the tariffs, commerce secretary wilbur ross summarized the white house's position as one that takes aim at unfairness and cited national security as the principal reason for the tariffs. in response, china's ministry of commerce warned of a ""firm and necessary"" response and asked that the tariffs be withdrawn ""as soon as possible so that the trading of products between china and the united states will return to a normal track.""",1
"however, bullish cryptocurrency investors remain resolute, with investor tim draper explaining that he thinks ""bitcoin is not volatile at all[;] all the fiat currencies are volatile by comparison as they fall away and down as they struggle to justify their existence in the face of the power and flexibility and ubiquity of bitcoin.""",1
"newer token and coin sales, many of which marketed themselves successfully on social media platforms and popular search engines faced additional headwinds as google and twitter banned new ""initial coin offering"" or ""ico"" ads. icos, a means of fundraising for new cryptocurrencies and a play on the equity market's initial public offering terminology, has so far been a successful albeit controversial means of funding for many blockchain-technology based startups.",1

"chainalysis collected data for a sample of 12 far-right entities in the u.s. and europe that publicly called for bitcoin donations and showed significant activity. together, they took in 213 bitcoin — worth more than $9 million at today’s value — between january 2017 and april 2021.",1

"two social media platforms that have been embraced by the far right, gab and bitchute, received a surge in bitcoin funding in the lead up to the jan. 6 u.s. capitol insurrection. since 2017, bitchute has gotten bitcoin worth nearly $500,000 at today’s values, about a fifth of which rolled in during the month of december 2020. gab has gotten more than $173,000; nearly 40% came in during december 2020 and january 2021, chainalysis data shows. on aug. 1, gab announced it was stepping up its fight against “financial censorship” and creating its own alternative to paypal to “fight against the tyranny of the global elites.”",1
"while cryptocurrencies have a reputation for secrecy, bitcoin was built for transparency. every transaction is indelibly — and publicly — recorded on the blockchain, which enables companies like chainalysis to monitor activity. individuals can obscure their identities by not publicly linking them to their cryptocurrency accounts, but with bitcoin they cannot hide the transactions themselves.",1
"“every bitcoin transfer is visible publicly. generally, your name is not attached to the address in a direct way, but spies from the various ‘woke’ anti-freedom organizations have unlimited resources to try to link these transactions to real names. with monero, the transactions are all hidden.” anglin wrote.",1
"thomas sewell, an australian neo-nazi currently facing charges, is soliciting donations in monero for his legal defense fund. jaz searby, a martial arts instructor who headed an australian chapter of the proud boys, is seeking donations — monero only — to help “spread our message to a generation of young aryan men that may feel alone or fail to understand the forces that are working against us.” the nordic resistance movement and counter-currents also solicit donations in other cryptocurrencies, including monero, and nrm has experimented with letting supporters mine monero directly on their behalf.",1
"“do you really think how we operate our economy is any of your business?” martin saxlind, the editor of nrm’s magazine, nordfront, asked ap in an email. “swedish banks have abused their control of the economy to deny us and others regular banking accounts for political reasons. that’s why we use cryptocurrency … you should investigate the corrupt banks instead of doing what i assume is some retarded hit piece on white dissidents.”",1
"the global minority initiative, which describes itself as a “prison relief charity” for american white nationalists also takes donations only in monero or by postal money order. and france’s democratie participative, a racist, anti-semitic, anti-lgbtq website that was banned by french courts in 2018, also solicits donations in monero only, warning supporters not to contribute via a mainstream cryptocurrency exchange.",1

"shortly before his suicide, in december 2020, a french computer programmer named laurent bachelier sent 28.15 bitcoins — then worth over $520,000 — to 22 far-right entities. the bulk went to nick fuentes, an american white nationalist influencer who would spend the coming weeks encouraging his tens of thousands of followers to lay siege to the u.s. capitol. one bitcoin went to a daily stormer account.",1
"“i care about what happens after my death,” bachelier wrote in his suicide note. “that’s why i decided to leave my modest wealth to certain causes and people. i think and hope that they will make a better use of it.”",0
"since getting bachelier’s money, fuentes has ramped up recruiting for his america first livestream and expanded the reach of his political nonprofit, the america first foundation, which says in corporate registration documents it advocates for “conservative values based on principles of american nationalism, christianity, and traditionalism.”",0
the transactions only became public because of a tip to a journalist at yahoo news and the fact that bachelier happened to leave digital traces that linked his bitcoin address with his email. the money trail offered clear evidence that domestic extremism isn’t purely domestic and showed how wealthy donors can use cryptocurrency to fund extremists around the world with little scrutiny.,1
"bachelier’s money slipped quietly into the u.s., not triggering alerts it might have had it landed via traditional banking channels. that’s because much of it — notably the bitcoin donation to fuentes, then worth $250,000 — passed through accounts that were not hosted by regulated cryptocurrency exchanges, according to chainalysis.",1
"those exchanges, which can convert bitcoin into u.s. dollars and other currencies, are generally regulated like banks, allowing authorities to get access to information or funds.",1
"but cryptocurrency wallets can also be “unhosted,” which means that users themselves control access. unhosted wallets — like fuentes’ — are akin to cash. they don’t have to go through banks or exchanges that could flag suspicious transactions, verify a user’s identity or hand over money to satisfy a court judgment.",1
"financial regulators around the world are waking up to the threat. the financial action task force, a paris-based multilateral organization that sets global guidelines to protect against money laundering and terrorism financing, in june released its first report on far-right fundraising, which highlighted the groups’ use of cryptocurrencies and warned that transnational links among such actors are growing. the fatf also said there is a dearth of information about both cross-border fundraising and the scale of cryptocurrency use.",1
"“similar to their jihadist counterparts, many of these groups have used the internet and social media to share propaganda and recruit ideologically-aligned supporters from around the world. they also may be looking to forge financial links,” the report said. “this trend has posed a challenge for law enforcement or security services which are used to combating erwt (extreme right-wing terrorism) as a domestic threat with few transnational links.”",0
"as the covid-19 pandemic sealed borders, white nationalists continued to gather in virtual communities that allowed them to connect with people from around the world.",0

"“the transnational links make people feel they are part of a much larger community, they can inspire each other and network,” said marilyn mayo, a senior research fellow at the anti-defamation league’s center on extremism.",0
"blockchain data shows that andrew anglin’s donors are part of a global community of believers who sent money to entities in multiple countries. donors to anglin since 2017 have also given bitcoin to 32 other far-right groups and people in at least five different countries, according to chainalysis data.",1
"the data also shows that money flowed into the sample of 12 far-right groups from cryptocurrency exchanges that serve customers all over the world, with western and eastern european-focused exchanges playing a growing role. chainalysis uses web traffic data and economic activity patterns to estimate where the customers that use a given exchange are located.",1
"european groups like the nordic resistance movement and génération identitaire also received donations from north america-focused exchanges. similarly, u.s. entities like american renaissance, daily stormer and wearechange got money via exchanges that serve customers in western and eastern europe.",1
"kimberly grauer, director of research at chainalysis, said the shift to using global exchanges “certainly could be in order to obfuscate detection, but it could also be a sign that increasingly donations are coming in from all over the world.”",0
"while andrew anglin remains physically hidden and his money remains virtually untouchable, his debt grows. each day that ticks by, he owes tanya gersh, a jewish real estate agent in montana, another $760.88, interest on a $14 million court judgment he has failed to pay.",0
"after gersh got in a dispute with the mother of white supremacist richard spencer in 2016, anglin published her contact information and used his website to whip up an army of trolls against her.",0
"she received death threats, threats against her as a jew and threats against her child. sometimes she’d pick up the phone and hear a gunshot. gersh’s hair started falling out. she had panic attacks, sought trauma counseling and seriously considered fleeing.",0
"the balm for all that came in 2019, when a federal court made clear that targeted anti-semitic hate speech is not protected by the first amendment. but since that fleeting moment of victory, nothing has happened. gersh has yet to see a penny of her $14 million.",0
"last september, gersh’s legal team sent requests to six ohio addresses and four emails demanding that he disclose his assets. four were returned as undeliverable, one was refused. he didn’t respond to the rest. the court then ordered anglin to hand over information about his finances, but the april 1 deadline for that came and went. her lawyers moved to hold him in contempt of court, which could lead to his arrest.",1
"anglin’s bitcoin is his most visible asset. gersh’s lawyers can see anglin’s virtual fortune but so far they haven’t been able to touch it. he also keeps his cryptocurrency in unhosted wallets, according to chainalysis, complicating collection efforts.",1
"“the problem with an unhosted wallet is what is your pain point?” said amanda wick, who served as a senior policy adviser for the treasury department’s financial crimes enforcement network and as a federal prosecutor before joining chainalysis as chief of legal affairs. “the only thing we have is civil contempt or criminal conviction. if someone is willing to sit in jail and the money is theirs on the other side because no one can access it, that’s a problem.”",1
"the hunt for anglin — and his pain point — continues. he may not be in the united states, but he is out there somewhere, littrell said, and he’s not untouchable.",0

in response tether said it has flagged the tokens — meaning that it will track them and prevent the holder from exchanging them through its service — and that it is working to recover them.,1
"for partners, the back-end wallet service has been suspended. tether said it will investigate the incident while it rolls out an update to omni core — its software for partners — that will prevent the stolen coins from recirculating into its ecosystem by essentially locking them into the alleged hacker’s wallet.",0

"btg maintainers said they did all that was possible on their end to help trading platforms prevent the attacks, but they did not have the legal power to intervene inside a private company like bittrex.",1
btg experts said hackers rented servers through the nicehash cryptocurrency mining market to overwhelm the bitcoin gold network and take control of more than half the btg network computational hashrate.,1
"this is what cryptocurrency experts call a ""51% attack,"" a dangerous scenario that grants attackers the ability to modify transaction details on the entire bitcoin gold network.",1
"the btg team says that during the 3.5 days attackers overwhelmed the bitcoin gold network, hackers deposited large quantities of bitcoin gold funds at cryptocurrency trading platforms.",1
"once funds were converted and stolen, hackers would then use their 51% control over the btg network to reverse the initial btg deposit, invalidating the transaction and returning their original bitcoin gold funds to their personal wallets. this second stage is what's known as a double-spend attack.",1
"at the time, btg maintainers repeatedly warned cryptocurrency trading platforms to raise transaction confirmation thresholds, a solution that would have made it more costly for attackers to mount a 51% attack.",1
"the btg maintainers also warned trading platforms about the attacker's wallet address, telling them to refuse any incoming btg deposits, and hence preventing the more devastating double-spend attack even if the 51% attack was successful.",1
"back in may, cryptocurrency experts said hackers successfully used this dual 51% & double-spend attack to steal over 388,000 btg coins (worth over $18 million at the time) from several cryptocurrency exchanges, but they did not reveal which platforms suffered losses during the attacks.",1

"according to court documents and statements made in court, “virtual currency” is a digital representation of a value that can be traded and functions as a medium of exchange.  virtual currency generally is not issued or guaranteed by any jurisdiction or government, and its value is decided by consensus within the community of users of the virtual currency.  a virtual currency generally self-generates units of currency through a process called “mining.”  a virtual currency “miner” is computer hardware that runs special computer software to solve complex algorithms that validate groups of transactions in that virtual currency.  once a complex algorithm is solved, a unit of currency, such as a bitcoin, is awarded to the individual operating the miner.  this process is known as “mining.”",1
"to generate business and attract customers and investors, garza made multiple false statements related to the scheme, including stating that gaw miners’ parent company purchased a controlling stake in zenminer for $8 million and that zenminer became a division of gaw miners.  in fact, there was no such transaction.  garza also stated that the hashlets garza’s companies sold engaged in the mining of virtual currency.  in fact, garza’s companies sold more hashlets than was supported by the computing power maintained in their data centers.  stated differently, garza’s companies sold the customers the right to more virtual currency than the companies’ computing power could generate.  garza also stated that the market value of a single paycoin would not fall below $20 per unit because garza’s companies had a reserve of $100 million that the companies would use to purchase paycoins to drive up its price.  in fact, no such reserve existed.",1
"during the scheme, garza, through his companies, used money his companies had made from new hashlet investors to pay older hashlet investors.  the payments were money that the companies owed the older investors based on the purported mining gaw miners and zenminer had done on the investors’ behalf.",1
"through this scheme, garza defrauded hundreds of individuals around the world of a total of $9,182,000.  judge chatigny ordered garza to pay restitution in that amount.",1

"the judgement, which was formally approved by a federal judge in connecticut on tuesday, comes months after garza pled guilty to a single criminal wire fraud charge. in may 2017, as part of the same lawsuit, garza’s companies were hit with a default judgment of more than $10 million. no representatives made any formal response to the lawsuit—garza himself invoked his fifth amendment privilege.",0
"according to the civil complaint, which was first brought by the securities and exchange commission in december 2015, garza and his companies sold more than 10,000 “investment contracts representing shares in the profits they claimed would be generated from using their purported computing power to ‘mine’ for virtual currency.”",1
the judgment against garza comes just days after the sec also sued a new york man and his two companies that were allegedly involved in fraudulent initial coin offerings despite the fact that “neither has any real operations.”,1
"in january 2015, garza told ars that he “started the company because of scammers.” he claimed that he first heard of bitcoin around a year ago, at which point he tried to buy a hardware mining rig and “spent $100,000 for a product i never got.” garza declined to say from which company he purchased the rig.",1
"“i’d never had any experience with that—realizing a couple weeks later that these guys didn’t care how much money i can afford to lose,” garza said. “i got really frustrated and thought we should start a company to try to fix this.”",0
"garza told ars that gaw (“geniuses at work”) made “over $1 million in sales our first month,” adding that, within a few months, “we leveled at $60 million to $80 million per year.”",1

the exchange promised to use cash from its own funds to pay out ¥46.3 billion ($426 million) toward covering its users' losses. that's about 20% less than the total value of the virtual tokens that were stolen.,1

"a japanese government spokesman said monday that coincheck would be asked to improve its business practices following the hack. financial authorities are supervising the company's response to the theft, he said.",1
"the coincheck hack is the latest in a series of attacks targeting digital currency exchanges. cybercriminals have been taking advantage of security weaknesses at young, often unregulated businesses that are handling huge sums of other people's money.",1

"mt gox, also based in japan, was the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange when hackers broke in and stole an estimated $400 million worth of bitcoin almost four years ago. mt gox went bankrupt shortly afterward and affected users still haven't been compensated.",1
"in a separate incident last month, hackers made off with more than $70 million worth of bitcoin from nicehash, a digital currency trading platform based in slovenia.",1
"the price of bitcoin slumped more than 7% after south korea's coinrail announced that it had been targeted by cyberthieves. in a statement monday, the exchange said that it had a suffered a security breach in which hackers stole about 30% of its virtual currencies.",1
coinrail said it had temporarily suspended trading in digital currencies and was fully cooperating with investigators to try to track down the missing funds. the exchange did not disclose the value of tokens stolen. the theft was of less well-known cryptocurrencies rather than bitcoin itself.,1
"still, the news sent shock waves through virtual currency markets. as well as bitcoin, prices for other commonly traded digital currencies like ethereum also plunged. nearly $30 billion in cryptocurrency wealth was wiped in about seven hours of trading, according to data provider coinmarketcap.com.",1
"bitcoin was trading at around $6,750 in early afternoon trading in asia. that's near its lowest level in about two months and around half the price at which it started the year.",1

"in january, japan's coincheck said hackers stole $530 million worth of virtual currency from its users in what ranks as the biggest such theft on record. that prompted a japanese authorities to step up scrutiny of exchanges.",1
lai said the coinrail hack intensified an already negative mood in cryptocurrency markets. the wall street journal reported friday that us investigators were demanding several bitcoin exchanges hand over trading data as part of a probe into potential manipulation of futures markets.,1

"some observers pinned the latest retreat on an exchange hack in south korea, while others pointed to lingering concern over a clampdown on trading platforms in china. cryptocurrency venues have come under growing scrutiny around the world in recent months amid a range of issues including thefts, market manipulation and money laundering.",1
"bitcoin has dropped about 12 percent since 5 p.m. new york time on friday and was trading at $6,756, bringing its decline this year to 53 percent. most other major virtual currencies also retreated, sending the market value of digital assets tracked by coinmarketcap.com to a nearly two-month low of $298 billion. at the height of the global crypto-mania in early january, they were worth about $830 billion.",1
"enthusiasm for virtual currencies has waned partly due to a string of cyber heists, including the nearly $500 million theft from japanese exchange coincheck inc. in late january. while the latest hacking target -- a south korean venue called coinrail -- is much smaller, the news triggered knee-jerk selling, according to stephen innes, head of asia pacific trading at oanda corp. in singapore.",1
"“the markets are so thinly traded, primarily by retail accounts, that these guys can get really scared out of positions,” he said. “it actually doesn’t take a lot of money to move the market significantly.”",1
"coinrail said in a statement on its website that some of the exchange’s digital currency appears to have been stolen by hackers, but it didn’t disclose how much. the venue added that 70 percent of the cryptocurrencies it holds are being kept safely in a cold wallet, which isn’t connected to the internet and is less vulnerable to theft. two-thirds of the stolen assets -- which the exchange identified as npxs, nper and atx coins -- have been frozen or collected, while the remaining one third is being examined by investigators, other exchanges and cryptocurrency development companies, it said.",1

"a controversial cryptocurrency project known as bancor—which last year raised $153 million to create a digital token exchange—hit another stumble: on monday afternoon, the company announced hackers had raided one of its online wallets to the tune of $23.5 million.",1
"news of the robbery came hours after bancor disclosed it had suffered an unspecified security breach. the company then issued a follow-up statement on twitter, explaining thieves had stolen ethereum tokens worth around $12.5 million and about $10 million worth of bancor’s native currency known as bnt.",1
"the robbery comes as the latest black eye for bancor, which last year conducted what was then the largest “initial coin offering” in history on the promise of creating a liquidity market for lesser used digital currencies. bancor is based on the premise of using a fluctuating price system to provide an outlet for selling those digital tokens—even if there is no available buyer for them.",1
"but despite bancor’s highly successful fundraising effort last july, which enjoyed the support of billionaire tim draper, many remained skeptical of its premise and the price of bnt tokens fell. in november, one prominent crypto investor told bloomberg, “my inner capitalist is just dumbfounded by the concept of bancor.”",1
"in its twitter statement, the company said it was able to freeze the movement of the bnt tokens, effectively stopping the thief from making off with them. but it was unable to do the same for the ethereum or for $1 million worth of a little known token called npxs.",1
"the company added that it has temporarily shut down its network while it addresses the security issues. meanwhile, the price of bancor tokens fell 14% on monday according to data from coinmarketcap.",1
"the robbery at bancor is just the latest example of crooks targeting digital token companies. in january, ernst & young reported that roughly 10% of all funds, or over $400 million, raised through initial coin offerings have been lost to hackers.",1
"attorney general william p. barr announced today the release of “cryptocurrency: an enforcement framework,” a publication produced by the attorney general’s cyber-digital task force.  the framework provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging threats and enforcement challenges associated with the increasing prevalence and use of cryptocurrency; details the important relationships that the department of justice has built with regulatory and enforcement partners both within the united states government and around the world; and outlines the department’s response strategies.",1
"“cryptocurrency is a technology that could fundamentally transform how human beings interact, and how we organize society.  ensuring that use of this technology is safe, and does not imperil our public safety or our national security, is vitally important to america and its allies,” said attorney general barr.  “i am grateful to the cyber-digital task force for producing this detailed report, which provides a cohesive, first-of-its kind framework for those seeking to understand federal enforcement priorities in this growing space.”",1
"“at the fbi, we see first-hand the dangers posed when criminals bend the important technological promise of cryptocurrency to illicit ends,"" said fbi director christopher wray.   “as this enforcement framework describes, we see criminals using cryptocurrency to try to prevent us from 'following the money’ across a wide range of investigations, as well as to trade in illicit goods like criminal tools on the dark web. for example, the cyber criminals behind ransomware attacks often use cryptocurrency to try to hide their true identities when acquiring malware and infrastructure, and receiving ransom payments. the men and women of the fbi are constantly innovating to keep pace with the evolution of criminals' use of cryptocurrency.""",1
"“the united states has been enormously successful blocking terrorists, rogue regimes, and their supporters from funding their activity using traditional currencies,” said task force member john c. demers, assistant attorney general for the national security division.  “as the cryptocurrency enforcement framework explains, we will adapt our strategy and tools to 21st century financing, including to combat the use of cryptocurrencies to evade enforcement and harm our national security.”",1
"“cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technology present tremendous promise for the future, but it is critical that these important innovations follow the law.  the cryptocurrency enforcement framework provides the public with important information intended to help them understand and comply with their obligations under the legal regimes that govern these new and fast-developing technologies,” said task force member brian c. rabbitt, the acting assistant attorney general for the criminal division.  “while the department of justice and its partners are committed to supporting the advancement of legitimate cryptocurrency technologies and uses, we will not hesitate to enforce the laws that govern these technologies when necessary to protect the public.”",1
"then, in part i, the framework provides a detailed threat overview, cataloging the three categories into which most illicit uses of cryptocurrency typically fall: (1) financial transactions associated with the commission of crimes; (2) money laundering and the shielding of legitimate activity from tax, reporting, or other legal requirements; and (3) crimes, such as theft, directly implicating the cryptocurrency marketplace itself.",1
"part ii explores the various legal and regulatory tools at the government’s disposal to confront the threats posed by cryptocurrency’s illicit uses, and highlights the strong and growing partnership between the department of justice and the securities and exchange commission, the commodity futures commission, and agencies within the department of the treasury, among others, to enforce federal law in the cryptocurrency space.",1
"finally, the enforcement framework concludes in part iii with a discussion of the ongoing challenges the government faces in cryptocurrency enforcement—particularly with respect to business models (employed by certain cryptocurrency exchanges, platforms, kiosks, and casinos), and to activity (like “mixing” and “tumbling,” “chain hopping,” and certain instances of jurisdictional arbitrage) that may facilitate criminal activity.",1
"the cryptocurrency enforcement framework is the second detailed report issued by the attorney general’s cyber-digital task force, which was established in february 2018 to answer two basic questions:  how is the department of justice responding to global cyber threats?  and how can federal law enforcement accomplish its mission in this area more effectively?  an earlier task force report, published in july 2018, canvassed a wide spectrum of cyber threats, ranging from transnational criminal enterprises’ sophisticated cyber-enabled schemes, to malign foreign influence operations, to efforts to compromise our nation’s critical infrastructure, and articulated the department’s priorities in detecting, deterring, and disrupting cyber threats.",1
"additional cyber-digital task force members include andrew e. lelling, united states attorney for the district of massachusetts, and two senior fbi executives.  components from across the department contributed to the cryptocurrency enforcement framework’s drafting.",1
"on october 8, 2020, the department of justice’s cyber-digital task force released an 83-page report entitled “cryptocurrency: an enforcement framework.” in an accompanying press release, attorney general barr remarked, “cryptocurrency is a technology that could fundamentally transform how human beings interact, and how we organize society.  ensuring that use of this technology is safe, and does not imperil our public safety or our national security, is vitally important to america and its allies.” the doj report highlights many of the legal and enforcement risks posed in the burgeoning crypto marketplace, and includes various enforcement case studies as well as informative graphics.",1
"after an introductory essay by the chair of the cyber-digital task force, the report is organized into three parts. part i begins with a brief survey of “legitimate” commercial uses for cryptocurrency, then describes three categories into which the doj believes most illicit uses of cryptocurrency typically fall. these illicit uses include (1) financial transactions associated with the commission of crimes or in support of terrorism; (2) money laundering and the shielding of legitimate activity from tax, reporting, or other legal requirements; and (3) direct commission of crimes, such as theft and fraud, that implicate the cryptocurrency marketplace itself.",1
"part ii discusses various legal and regulatory techniques the government deploys to confront illicit uses of cryptocurrency. it also highlights the increased cooperation among the department of justice and other government agencies such as the sec, the cftc, and various units within the department of the treasury, to enforce federal laws in the cryptocurrency space.",1

"why should global anti-money laundering efforts be concerned with ccs if “in practice few people actually use, or perceive, bitcoin as money in a traditional sense” ([16], p. 3)?.recent calls to expand studies of money ([17], p. 19) and heterodox understandings of money [18, 19] point to at least two reasons why ccs remain relevant to global anti-money laundering efforts. first, global anti-money laundering governance is concerned with illicit transactions and financial flows whether or not they meet theoretical standards of money. these global efforts seek to combat the ‘mainstreaming’ of proceeds from illicit activities into the legitimate financial system by preventing the linking of financial “upperworlds” and “underworlds” [20]. a second reason why ccs remain relevant to global anti-money laundering governance is due to the novel manners in which altcoins enable the nearly real-time undertaking, verification and publication of transactions across political boundaries. as the following subsections explore in turn, the decentralised and quasi-anonymous features of ccs potentially threaten longstanding global anti-money laundering efforts.",1
"the yet to be proven implication of ccs in money laundering has nevertheless led institution from the financial ‘upperworld’ to refrain from interacting with much of the ‘altcoin’ ecosystem. leading insurers have shied away from underwriting insurance on ccs despite the clear need for such coverage stemming from continual breaches of both altcoin ‘banks’ and exchanges. in 2014 the british bank hsbc abandoned its cc hedge fund in order to avoid potential implication in further money laundering scandals [41]. the bis has noted how banks have “tended not to engage directly with digital currency intermediaries” and “sought to avoid interaction as a result of perceptions of risk and uncertainty over legal or compliance issues (such as aml/cft)” ([34], p. 7). large, multinational banks have sought to avoid further costs involved with aml compliance [42]. the managing director of american bank morgan stanley argued in a 2016 that until the “key question of who will be in charge” is settled, banks would not take ccs “seriously, principally because of anti-money laundering and ‘know your customer’ (kyc) rules” [43].",1
"firms in the ‘altcoin’ ecosystem have developed varying aml-compliant cc services. bitinstant, a now defunct leading new york city-based issuer of cc debit cards, promoted voluntary registration and compliance with aml laws. exchanges of ccs into state-backed moneys, such as hong kong-based bitfinex, require customers to undertake more “comprehensive and thorough kyc and aml compliance implementation” that involves the provision of certified identification documents and valid proof of address [45]. btc china [46], hong kong-based gatecoin [47], as well as the british exchanges bitstamp [48] and its rival cex.io [49] all enforce minimum aml standards by requiring customers to provide copies of their passports in verifying their identities. these firm-level aml efforts however vary considerably, with cc exchanges like hitbtc requiring identification only for account holders that they deem to be “suspicious” [50].",1
"yet ‘races to the bottom’ are also often accompanied by ‘races to the top’. new york state and other jurisdictions have attempted to distinguish themselves as legitimate centres for cc activity. singapore has since 2014 required virtual currency exchanges based in the city-state to verify customer identities and report suspicious transactions to its suspicious transaction reporting office [28, 85]. the english channel island of alderney has set up a cluster of aml-compliant cc services in its attempt to become the leading international cc transaction centre [86]. competing for the title of “bitcoin isle” is the neighbouring isle of man, which amended its main aml legislation to include ccs and is developing similar “pioneering regulation and funding schemes” [87]. such efforts to create legitimate aml-compliant jurisdictions, however, do little to limit the potential for money laundering activities to thrive other jurisdictions.",0
"national authorities have also sought to impose their aml requirements on cc operations beyond their jurisdictions. in may 2013 the us department of homeland security issued a seizure warrant to the american-based firm undertaking transfers for the once dominant tokyo-based cc exchange mt. gox, which complied and received a money business service license only months before filing for bankruptcy protection following a devastating hack [61]. beyond this prominent case and scholarly suggestions to rely on american hegemony [64], however, extraterritorial applications of us laws only go so far in providing legitimate global rather than unilateral aml standards for ccs. the unappealing choice for national regulators to either blatantly submit to the jurisdiction of american law or to impose bans to mitigate the use of ccs has instigated global level efforts.",0
"the limits of both industry- and national-level governance have instigated calls for coordinated global efforts to mitigate the potential uses of ccs for money laundering without curtailing their more beneficial features. the bis argues that “[g]iven the nature of digital currencies, which are typically online and therefore not limited to national jurisdictions, a coordinated approach at a global level may be important for regulation to be fully effective” ([88], p. 12). technologists isaac pflaum and emmeline hateley ([64], p. 1196) have also argued that “it is not possible to regulate virtual currency effectively at the international level without significant assistance between states that permit its usage”. such global collective action problems are certainly not new, having afflicted the governance of a range of emergent technologies in the past [89].",0
"several international organisations have been vying to provide standards coordinating national aml laws and regulations relevant to ccs. the united nations office on drugs and crime (unodc) issued a detailed manual in 2014 for detecting and seizing ccs implicated in money laundering and, along with the organization for security and cooperation in europe (osce), has been training officials to investigate money laundering through ccs [90]. in 2015 the international organisation of securities commissioners (iosco) established a “blockchain taskforce” [91] while the commonwealth convened a ten member working group on virtual currencies in parallel efforts to coordinate aml approaches. similarly, interpol and europol have established a joint partnership coordinating police activities “against the abuse of virtual currencies for criminal transactions and money laundering” [92]. the following section scrutinises efforts by the intergovernmental organisation specifically designed to coordinate aml efforts.",0
"what measures does the fatf then suggest regulatory authorities undertake in responding to exchanges or other actors in breach of aml requirements? its 2015 guidance calls for such exchanges to be met with “enhanced due diligence measures” ([99], p. 8). these measures include straightforward prohibition ([99], p. 9) as well as “a range of effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions (criminal, civil or administrative)” ([99], p. 10). what on first glance appears to form a rather ‘harsh’ governance approach is nuanced by subsequent suggestions that coercive measures “should take into account, among other things, the impact a prohibition would have on the local and global level of ml/tf [money laundering/terrorist finance] risks, including whether prohibiting vc [virtual currency] payments activities could drive them underground, where they will continue to operate without aml/cft controls or oversight” ([99], p. 9). in other words, the fatf urges national authorities to recognise how complete bans on cc might further exasperate regulatory arbitrage and “cross-border” divergences in the governance of exchanges operating as key nodes between the financial “upperworlds” and “underworlds” [18].",1
"the proceeding evaluation stresses a different understanding of effectiveness: the balance achieved between mitigating the potential challenges without curtailing the actual opportunities presented for aml efforts. this understanding of effectiveness is invoked for two reasons. first, as the 2015 fatf guidance on ccs is only rather slowly being transposed into national and regional regulations, the narrower emphasis on the success of efforts to standardise varying aml efforts is difficult to presently assess. second, with little evidence currently implicating ccs in money laundering it is important to consider whether the potential benefits of blockchain technology for global aml efforts are also being promoted by the fatf.",0
"unsurprisingly, cc supporters have criticised fatf suggestions that existing aml standards be extended to the ‘alt-coin’ ecosystem. doing so, industry proponents have maintained, would once again lead cc activities to flow to parts of illicit financial system that remain effectively ‘off-limits’ to regulators. industry bodies such as the digital finance institute have argued that the “regulate or shut down” [23] approach advocated by the fatf would not only force parts of the cc ecosystem into the illicit ‘underworld’ but lead institutions from the financial ‘upperworld’ to avoid engagement with cc operators due to longstanding concerns with the costs of aml compliance (see more generally [105], p. 621, 628–9). in avoiding engagement with ccs, financial institutions seek to ‘de-risk’ by forfeiting involvement in activities where the costs of complying with aml regulations are regarded as outweighing any potential gains.",1
"three more specific criticisms can be levied at the fatf’s risk-based approach. first, the fatf perpetuates the heavy reliance of global aml governance on market actors ([94, 105, 109, 110], p. 620). the 2015 guidance proposes that countries require financial and non-financial firms to assess money laundering risks themselves when dealing with ccs. indeed, the very first clause advocates that market actors “refine technical processes used to reliably identify and verify customers” ([99], p. 12). the fatf also calls on industry associations to “develop policies and practices for members that allow them to identify specific transactions as coming from a member that has applied appropriate [customer due diligence] cdd and is conducting appropriate transaction monitoring” ([99], p. 14). this emphasis on market initiatives (e.g. [99], p. 8) overlooks problems involved with relying on industry-sponsored data, as well as for regulators to be materially and intellectually ‘capture’ by industry interests ([111, 112] p. 152–3). top-down attempts at fostering industry cooperation have spurned push-back from the decentralised cc community, including denunciations by leading individuals in the blockchain alliance, an organisation consisting of 16 cc servicers and seven american regulatory agencies [113]. the fatf has sought to justify its emphasis on market solutions by arguing that the inability to “target one central location or entity for investigative purposes… undermines countries’ ability to employ effective, dissuasive sanctions” and “presents a significant challenge to law enforcement’s ability to trace illicit proceeds that are laundered” ([99], p. 11). despite its recognition of such difficulties, the fatf suggests national authorities review these challenges in order “to identify potential gaps and take action” ([99], p. 11) like “licensing and registration” as well as nudging exchanges to adopt “customer identification/verification and recordkeeping requirements”. in short, the risk-based approach tends to overlook the risks involved with a reliance on industry solutions.",1
"even longstanding critics of technology-based solutions have recognised the “enormous potential” that the blockchain underlying ccs provide for addressing a range of governance gaps (cited in [126]). blockchains may specifically contribute to least two aspects of global aml efforts. first, private and semi-private ‘permissioned’ blockchains allow centralised entities to authorise access to particular ccs [127]. identabit and cambridge blockchain for instance have built-in proof of identity features that go far beyond the voluntary user registration relied upon by even the most aml-friendly cc exchanges [128]. one of the chief competitors to the bitcoin blockchain, ripple, has sealed ‘gateways’ that authenticate identities and grant permission to users of its cc, which is called xrp. such gateways have led ripple to be regarded as far more “aml friendly” by the institute of international finance, the leading global banking sector association, which has praised the potential of this cc to “enforce various supervisory measures such as know-your-client (kyc) and anti-money laundering (aml) procedures” [129]. firms from the financial ‘upperworld’ have also made considerable investments in permissioned blockchains to minimise the money laundering potential of ‘alt-coins’ [92]. the fatf guidance ([99], p.14) endorses these additional applications of blockchain technologies, explicitly advocating for developments “built on fundamentally different underlying protocols that can build-in risk mitigants or facilitate customer identification and transaction monitoring”.",1
"a wealthy individual who needed to prove their identity could walk into a pwc office with their passport and identity documents […] the firm’s staff would run checks on who the person was, then scan and upload the documents on to the blockchain. the next time that person wanted to prove their identity, they could refer to those records, eliminating the need for later paperwork costing time and money (cited in [135]).",1
"these blockchain-based initiatives respond to calls to establish profiles of ‘altcoin’ users by drawing on big data analytics in identifying individuals associated with particular cc addresses [23]. as the journalist sarah jeong [136] explains, “because the bitcoin network necessarily broadcasts the history of all transactions ever made, analysis of this data can unveil revealing information about particular nodes and their transactional activities”. by locating particular patterns of use, companies like blocktrail and coinanalytics enhance the ability of intergovernmental police organisations like europol and interpol to match cc transactions with individual profiles [53, 137]. transaction flows are associated with identities matching specific users by drawing on so-called cc ‘forensics’ developed by computer scientists [138, 139]. these and other initiatives illustrate the “function creep” [140] of blockchain technologies towards contributing to rather than solely undermining the information and identification efforts of global aml governance. they also more widely exemplify how novel technologies not only challenge but may also support regulatory efforts [141, 142]. the paradox of blockchain technology is therefore that while aml efforts must “deal with imperfect knowledge of identities”, they “may exploit perfect knowledge of all transactions” [108].",0
"complex attempts to maintain anonymity and avoid centralisation threaten to push the cc ecosystem further into to financial ‘underworld’ while limiting its wider attraction for either legitimate or illegitimate uses as traditional forms of money in the financial ‘upperworld’. indeed, the practical and intellectual complexities involved with ‘mixing’ and further encryption of transactions are unlikely to enhance the attractiveness of these ccs for money laundering nor for more everyday monetary transactions. legal researcher have already attributed the lack of “large-scale” money laundering with ccs to “a lack of technical knowledge and resources among the relevant populations” ([33], p. 336). short of significant reductions in these not insignificant technical hurdles, the fatf guidance provides an effective balance between the actual opportunities and potential challenges that the advent of ccs presents to global aml governance.",1
"how effectively has the global aml regime balanced the challenges and opportunities presented by the emergence of bitcoin and competing ccs? this article contended that in spite of several important limits, the risk-based approach pursued by the fatf currently provides an effective balance in mitigating the potential risks and actual opportunities that ccs present to global aml efforts. its decentralised risk-based approach was regarded as appropriate for addressing money laundering in the decentralised networks in which cc transactions occur. the fatf more widely approach accords with networked and experimental forms of governance that appear to be more effective than centralised forms of coercion in digital realms where operations can shift to less restrictive jurisdictions with relative ease and speed. nevertheless, this argument was advanced cautiously, recognising several risks with the ‘risk-based approach’, such as the reliance on technologies and market-based solutions.",1
"together then these arguments should be taken as a call for moderation between inaction and overreaction. networked and decentralised global governance approaches still involve persistent roles for the monitoring for which the fatf is renowned. yet, should ccs begin to more closely resemble conventional forms of money- particularly as media of exchange and more stable stores of value- as well as to be used for money laundering, then more traditional approaches will need to be considered. how exactly ‘harsher’ approaches, such as those undertaken to shut down silk road 1.0 and 2.0, might be implemented and international coordinated in manners that avoid global races to the bottom remain of central importance for policy-makers and scholars alike to consider.",0
"wider methodological and epistemological issues also require further contemplation. how can evidence of money laundering be collected from activities characterised by pseudo-anonymity? how much evidence might be necessary to justify more coercive international actions? how can the coordination and assessment of global anti-money laundering efforts evaluate the ethical implications arising from applications of novel technologies that allow for both the undertaking and monitoring of digital transactions? scholars are only now beginning to address these wider issues with regards to ccs [e.g. 149–151]. just as the horizons of research on money can be expanded, so too can measurements of effectiveness include the ethical, political, social, as well as economic implications stemming from the rapid and unpredictable changes to the character of global financial flows in the twenty-first century.",0
"units of ccs are conventionally put in lowercase. estimates vary regarding when precisely production of bitcoin will peak, with some indicating the year 2040 and others a century later.",1

"the original silk road was shut down by the us federal bureau of investigation (fbi) in 2013. the alleged creator of the website, the american ross ulbricht, was sentenced to life in prison without parole for money laundering amongst other charges. silk road 2.0 was then closed down in 2014 following an international operation by police agencies from 17 different countries. silk road 3.0 once again opened in mid-2016 revealing the longer-term limit to international police crackdowns [32].",1
"europol ([49], p. 46) notes, but offers no supporting evidence of the claim that bitcoin features “heavily in many eu law enforcement investigations, accounting over 40% of all identified criminal-to-criminal payments”.",1
"the hackers, technologists, and “wildcat bankers” [54] forming the cc community are renown for wariness of centralised authority. they tend to promote a world of small government and diminished state sovereignty.",0
"the money laundering potential of ccs attracted further formal attention in the european union following the november 2015 paris terrorist attacks as the european commission ([85], p. 39) proposed to amend the fourth anti-money laundering directive to bring cc exchanges under existing aml laws and create “a central database registering [cc] users’ identities”.",0

"miners are the producers of ccs who are rewarded with new ccs for verifying transactions. brett scott provides a useful comparison in likening these actors to a “network of clerks who check to see that participants actually have the funds they claim to have, and who then record a change to the decentralized blockchain ledger” ([21], p. 2). originally indended to be undertaken by individual personal computers, the computing power required to profitably verify the growing number of transactions on the bitcoin blockchain now requires specialised computer rigs. the complexity and expense of such operations has led to the formation of teams- also known as alliances, collectives or ‘pools’- of miners who now control large shares of bitcoin mining. the size of these pools can be tracked at <https://blockchain.info/pools>.",1

"revenue rose 82% in 2021 to $7.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen from victims. over $2.8 billion of this total — which is nearly equal to the increase over 2020’s total — came from rug pulls, a relatively new scam type in which developers build what appear to be legitimate cryptocurrency projects — meaning they do more than simply set up wallets to receive cryptocurrency for, say, fraudulent investing opportunities — before taking investors’ money and disappearing. please keep in mind as well that these figures for rug pull losses represent only the value of investors’ funds that were stolen, and not losses from the defi tokens’ subsequent loss of value following a rugpull.",1
"we should note that roughly 90% of the total value lost to rug pulls in 2021 can be attributed to one fraudulent centralized exchange, thodex, whose ceo disappeared soon after the exchange halted users’ ability to withdraw funds. however, every other rug pull tracked by chainalysis in 2021 involved defi projects. in nearly all of these cases, developers have tricked investors into purchasing tokens associated with a defi project before draining the tools provided by those investors, sending the token’s value to zero in the process.",1
"we believe rug pulls are common in defi for two related reasons. one is the hype around the space. defi transaction volume has grown 912% in 2021, and the incredible returns on decentralized tokens like",0
"have many excited to speculate on defi tokens. at the same time, it’s very easy for those with the right technical skills to create new defi tokens and get them listed on exchanges, even without a code audit. a code audit is a process by which a third-party firm or listing exchange analyzes the code of the smart contract behind a new token or other defi project, and publicly confirms that the contract’s governance rules are iron clad and contain no mechanisms that would allow for the developers to make off with investors’ funds. many investors could likely have avoided losing funds to rug pulls if they’d stuck to defi projects that have undergone a code audit – or if dexes required code audits before listing tokens.",0
"cryptocurrency theft grew even more, with roughly $3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen in 2021 — a 516% increase compared to 2020. roughly $2.3 billion of those funds — 72% of the 2021 total — were stolen from defi protocols. the increase in defi-related thefts represents the acceleration of a trend",1
"defi is one of the most exciting areas of the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem, presenting huge opportunities to entrepreneurs and cryptocurrency users alike. but defi is unlikely to realize its full potential if the same decentralization that makes it so dynamic also allows for widespread scamming and theft. one way to combat this is better communication — both the private and public sectors have an important role to play in helping investors learn how to avoid dubious projects. in the longer term, the industry may also need to take more drastic steps to prevent tokens associated with potentially fraudulent or unsafe projects from being listed on major exchanges.",1

"defi-related crime and criminal cryptocurrency balances are just one area of focus for this report. we’ll also look at the latest data and trends on other forms of cryptocurrency-based crime, including:",1
"as cryptocurrency continues to grow, it’s imperative that the public and private sectors work together to ensure that users can transact safely, and that criminals can’t abuse these new assets. we hope that this report can contribute to that goal, and equip law enforcement, regulators, and compliance professionals with the knowledge to more effectively prevent, mitigate, and investigate cryptocurrency-based crime.",1

"it says most cryptocurrency is laundered through a limited number of services - for example, particular exchanges favoured by criminals - and shutting these could have a big impact.",1

"however, europol said the trend is rising: ""the use of cryptocurrencies in money laundering schemes has been increasing, and many criminal networks relied on cryptocurrencies as a payment medium during the covid-19 pandemic.""",1
"money from offline crime, such as cash from drug trafficking, converted into cryptocurrency to be laundered is not included, and this could be a growth area, the report suggests.",1
"a courier would collect the cash from the dealers and deliver it to a broker who would arrange for it to be converted into bitcoin and then send it to an address specified by the crime group, taking a 4% fee.",1
"that is low compared to more traditional forms of money laundering, the report argues, ""suggesting that bitcoin-based laundering could become increasingly attractive to traditional criminals"".",1
"the report suggests that so-called ""decentralised finance"" (defi) protocols have become more important to criminals trying to hide cash - receiving 17% of all funds sent from illicit wallets in 2021, up from 2% the previous year.",1
"for example, the firm noted, they were widely used by with north korea-affiliated hackers responsible for $400m worth of cryptocurrency hacks last year.",1
"reacting to the report, paul radu, director of the organized crime and corruption reporting project, said criminals were ""always early adopters of technology and they embraced cryptocurrencies a decade ago"".",1
"he added: ""since then, their sophistication grew, while unfortunately law enforcement and other investigators (including journalists) who follow the money are still playing catch-up.""",0
"cybercriminals laundered $8.6 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2021, a figure that represents a 30% increase on the previous year. centralised exchanges are still the favourite conduit for sending and receiving illicit cryptocurrency, receiving 47% of funds sent by addresses linked to crimes last year. but it is defi protocols that are experiencing the boom in money laundering activity.",1
"defi protocols offer financial instruments on the blockchain without relying on intermediaries like banks and have previously been identified as a key area of growth for cryptocurrency criminality in general. approximately $2.2bn worth of cryptocurrency was embezzled from defi protocols in 2021, representing 72% of all cryptocurrency theft in 2021.",1
"data provider chainalysis has also reported a 1,964% year-over-year increase in the total value of cryptocurrency laundered through defi protocols, reaching a total of $900 million in 2021. and these figures only account for funds generated through cryptocurrency-based crime, such as darknet market sales and ransomware attacks. the true figure for defi money laundering activity, incorporating profits made from ‘offline’ crimes like drug trafficking that are then converted into cryptocurrency, is likely to be far higher.",1
"money laundering involving cryptocurrencies is, in itself, nothing new. it still involves placing ill-gotten funds into the financial eco-system, which crypto exchanges are now a part of, before transferring the money to obscure its origin. the process is meant to allow criminals to use the funds without it alerting the attention of the authorities. there are, however, some important distinctions between traditional and cryptocurrency-based money laundering.",1
"cryptocurrency can provide added anonymity for cybercriminals, and the majority of crypto exchanges and virtual asset service providers (vasps) currently operate with significantly less regulatory scrutiny and can be used to circumvent international borders. but while cryptocurrency may provide some advantages over traditional methods of money laundering, the technology is also publicly recorded and publicly accessible – making each and every transaction traceable.",1
"because of this, cybercriminals are increasingly turning to mechanisms that can further obscure the origin of their cryptocurrency funds. one such method involves joining a ‘mining pool’, where cryptocurrency miners pool their resources and share their processing power to split the reward of finding a blockchain block. money launderers can also use bitcoin ‘mixers’, which obfuscate the data that links an individual to a bitcoin transfer.",1
"in the uk, authorities’ response to cryptocurrency money laundering has been informed by the proceeds of crime act (poca). although its three central offences - the concealing offence, the arranging offence and the acquisition or use offence - are clear, poca was drafted in in 2002, when cryptocurrency was clearly not at the forefront of lawmakers’ minds. all businesses that conduct cryptoasset activities in the uk are, however, required to be registered with the financial conduct authority, in line with a 2019 update to the money laundering regulations.",1
"regulators and law enforcement agencies are certain to evolve the playbooks they use to identify not just the proceeds of crime, which are subject to seizure, but also any individuals or entities involved in illicit dealings who may have had ‘reasonable cause to suspect’ that funds were tainted.",0
"organisations that deal with cryptocurrencies need to ensure their financial crime framework is reviewed and updated to account for the risks associated with cryptocurrencies. blockchain analytical tools can assist organisations that accept payments or transfers in cryptocurrencies to trace the origins of the funds - including if there are any links to addresses associated with illicit activity. additionally, firms can leverage digital identification tools to assess customer transactions against the customer profiles.",1

"using those three criteria, we show on the pie chart below the share of total ransomware revenue that went to strains affiliated with russian organizations in 2021.",1
"an estimated 13% of funds sent from ransomware addresses to services went to users estimated to be in russia, more than any other region. that brings us to another point: a huge amount of cryptocurrency-based money laundering, not just of ransomware funds but of funds associated with other forms of cybercrime as well, goes through services with substantial operations in russia.",1
"russia is home to several cryptocurrency businesses that have processed substantial transaction volume from illicit addresses. in order to illustrate the scope of the problem, we thought it would be interesting to zoom in on businesses headquartered or with a significant presence in the capital’s financial district, moscow city. chainalysis is tracking several dozen cryptocurrency businesses operating in moscow city alone that facilitate significant amounts of money laundering.",1
"note: the word “risky” here defines addresses connected to entities that, while not necessarily inherently criminal, are frequently linked to criminal activity, such as high-risk exchanges and mixers.",1
"note: “cybercriminal administrator” refers to addresses that have been attributed to individuals connected to a cybercriminal organization, such as a darknet market.",1
"overall, the moscow city cryptocurrency businesses we track vary greatly in the role that money laundering plays in their overall business. some of them are big enough that despite receiving millions of dollars’ worth of funds from illicit addresses, those funds only represent 10% or less of all cryptocurrency they receive. those instances could be attributed to the business’s lack of knowledge, rather than purposeful criminal activity. but for other moscow city cryptocurrency businesses, illicit funds make up as much as 30% or more of all cryptocurrency received, which suggests those businesses may be making a concerted effort to serve a cybercriminal clientele.",1

"regardless of what the future holds, it’s important to understand where things stand now: russian cybercriminal organizations are some of the biggest perpetrators of cryptocurrency-based crime — especially ransomware — and local cryptocurrency businesses provide money laundering services that enable this activity. 2021 saw positive momentum against this issue, from the",1

"when the united states barred americans from doing business with russian banks, oil and gas developers and other companies in 2014, after the country’s invasion of crimea, the hit to russia’s economy was swift and immense. economists estimated that sanctions imposed by western nations cost russia $50 billion a year.",1
"since then, the global market for cryptocurrencies and other digital assets has ballooned. that’s bad news for enforcers of sanctions, and good news for russia.",1
"on tuesday, the biden administration enacted fresh sanctions on russia over the conflict in ukraine, aiming to thwart its access to foreign capital. but russian entities are preparing to blunt some of the worst effects by making deals with anyone around the world willing to work with them, experts said. and, they say, those entities can then use digital currencies to bypass the control points that governments rely on — mainly transfers of money by banks — to block deal execution.",1
"“russia has had a lot of time to think about this specific consequence,” said michael parker, a former federal prosecutor who now heads the anti-money-laundering and sanctions practice at the washington law firm ferrari & associates. “it would be naïve to think that they haven’t gamed out exactly this scenario.”",0
sanctions are some of the most powerful tools the united states and european countries have to influence the behavior of nations they don’t consider allies. the united states in particular is able to use sanctions as a diplomatic tool because the dollar is the world’s reserve currency and used in payments worldwide. but american government officials are increasingly aware of the potential for cryptocurrencies to lessen the impact of sanctions and are stepping up their scrutiny of digital assets.,1
"to apply sanctions, a government makes a list of people and businesses its citizens must avoid. anyone caught engaging with a member of the list faces heavy fines. but the real key to any effective sanctions program is the global financial system. banks around the world play a major role in enforcement: they see where money comes from and where it’s bound, and anti-money-laundering laws require them to block transactions with entities that are under sanctions and report what they see to authorities. but if banks are the eyes and ears of governments in this space, the explosion of digital currencies is blinding them.",1
"banks have to abide by “know your customer” rules, which include verifying their clients’ identities. but exchanges and other platforms that facilitate the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies and digital assets are rarely as good at tracking their customers as banks are, even though they are supposed to follow the same rules. in october, the u.s. treasury department warned that cryptocurrencies posed an increasingly serious threat to the american sanctions program and that u.s. authorities needed to educate themselves about the technology.",1
"should it choose to evade sanctions, russia has multiple cryptocurrency-related tools at its disposal, experts said. all it needs is to find ways to trade without touching the dollar.",1
"the russian government is developing its own central bank digital currency, a so-called digital ruble that it hopes to use to trade directly with other countries willing to accept it without first converting it into dollars. hacking techniques like ransomware could help russians steal digital currencies and make up revenue lost to sanctions.",1
"and while cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on the underlying blockchain, making them transparent, new tools developed in russia can help mask the origin of such transactions. that would allow businesses to trade with russian entities without detection.",1
"in october 2020, representatives of russia’s central bank told a moscow newspaper that the new “digital ruble” would make the country less dependent on the united states and better able to resist sanctions. it would let russian entities conduct transactions outside the international banking system with any country willing to trade in digital currency.",0
"russia could find willing partners in other nations targeted by u.s. sanctions, including iran, that are also developing government-backed digital currencies. china, russia’s largest trading partner in both imports and exports, according to the world bank, has already launched its own central bank digital currency. the country’s leader, xi jinping, recently described china’s relationship with russia as having “no limits.”",1
"the developing system in which central banks directly exchange digital currencies creates new risks, said yaya fanusie, a fellow at the center for a new american security who has studied the effects of cryptocurrency on sanctions. “the lessening of u.s. sanctions power comes from a system where these nation-states are able to do transactions without going through the global banking system.”",1
"in early february, independent sanctions monitors told the u.n. security council that north korea was using cryptocurrencies to fund its nuclear and ballistic missile program, according to reuters. (a spokesman for norway’s permanent mission to the u.n. confirmed the existence of the report, which has not yet been made public.) in may, the consulting firm elliptic described how iran was using revenue from bitcoin mining to make up for the limitations on its ability to sell oil because of sanctions.",1
"russian entities that are under sanctions could deploy their own evasion strategy, using ransomware attacks. the playbook is straightforward: a hacker breaks into computer networks and locks up digital information until the victim pays for its release, usually in cryptocurrency.",1
"russia is at the center of the growing ransomware industry. last year, about 74 percent of global ransomware revenue, or more than $400 million worth of cryptocurrency, went to entities that are probably affiliated with russia in some way, according to a feb. 14 report by the blockchain-tracking firm chainalysis.",1
"illegal funds have also flowed into russia through a dark web marketplace called hydra, which is powered by cryptocurrency and handled more than $1 billion in sales in 2020, according to chainalysis. the platform’s strict rules — sellers are allowed to liquidate cryptocurrency only through certain regional exchanges — have made it difficult for researchers to follow the money.",1
"“we know that there’s no questions asked, and we know that hydra operates not just throughout eastern europe but throughout western europe,” said kim grauer, director of research at chainalysis. “there’s definitely cross-border business happening.”",1
"but the technology behind hydra masks the source of transactions, offering a potential tool for russian users to move money outside the country’s borders. on its own, hydra is not yet big enough to handle the volume of transactions that russia would need to successfully evade sanctions. but other money-laundering techniques — including “nesting,” in which an illicit marketplace buries itself within a larger, legitimate structure to hide its activities — could also help.",1
"there are signs that the united states is stepping up its monitoring of cryptocurrency activity. on feb. 17, the justice department announced that it had created a new national cryptocurrency enforcement team, a move that seemed to emphasize that federal prosecutors were paying extra attention to bad behavior among cryptocurrency users.",1
"administration officials are also urging the cryptocurrency industry to put into place internal controls that prevent bad actors from using their services. in october, the treasury department published a 30-page sanctions-compliance manual recommending that cryptocurrency companies use geolocation tools to weed out customers in restricted jurisdictions. in many cases, the report said, crypto companies have taken months or years to carry out such compliance procedures.",1
"that may change as the industry starts to mature. chainalysis offers a “know your transaction” tool that alerts companies when blacklisted entities use their services. last year, the company doubled its number of private-sector customers, many of whom use the compliance tool.",1

"cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, work on a technology known as blockchain, a decentralized network of synchronized online registries that track the ownership and value of each token. they can be used as virtual cash and traded like currency. private companies can issue their own virtual currencies to finance specific ventures, similar to crowdfunding or bonds. and their future value can also be traded, like options.",1
"with approximately $70 billion in bitcoins in circulation and more than 100,000 merchants around the world—including russia's largest online retailer, ulmart—accepting similar forms of payment, ""suddenly everyone has to take cryptocurrency seriously,"" says richard titus, an investor of cybermoney. virtual currencies are also a potential bonanza for money launderers, online blackmailers and cybercriminals—especially in russia. and with the market still basically unregulated, titus warns, ""it's definitely the wild west."" even jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon, usually a bull on tech innovation, warned in september that virtual currencies are ""a fraud.… it won't end well. someone is going to get killed. it will blow up.""",1
"russians have been involved in cryptocurrencies since their inception in the mid-2000s. criminals used the first virtual currencies, such as e-gold, to commit cross-border credit card fraud. the original technology was ""mostly u.s.-based, but it was always linked to russia,"" where 80 to 90 percent of global card fraud activity took place, says alexander klimburg, author of  the darkening web, a newly published examination of cybersecurity threats.",1
"the kremlin has long been wary of cryptocurrencies, which are technically illegal in russia—yet the government recently signaled it's changing its stance. at the st. petersburg international economic forum in june, president vladimir putin announced that russia was considering launching its own ""digital ruble"" and praised the possibilities of virtual currencies. a group of financial institutions under the supervision of the russian central bank is testing a proprietary ""master chain"" based on a popular platform called ethereum that could be used to issue bit-rubles.",1
"there's even been talk of creating a supranational cryptocurrency for the emerging brics nations—brazil, russia, india, china and south africa—as ""a good alternative to the dollar,"" kirill dmitriev, head of the russian direct investment fund, told state-run news agency ria novosti in august. though the entire sum of cryptocurrencies in the world remains under $100 billion, a long way off the estimated 10.2 trillion u.s. dollars, the idea of undermining america's dominion as owner of the world's chief reserve currency appeals to putin, who recently called for the brics nations ""to overcome the excessive domination of the limited number of reserve currencies.""",1
"there are other legitimate reasons moscow is interested in cashing in on cryptocurrencies. the kremlin is keen to attract the enormous cash flow being poured into blockchain projects around the world. it also wants to open up russia to the bitcoin mining industry, in which anyone can claim newly issued bitcoins—generated automatically by a preprogrammed, blockchain-based computer network—by solving extremely complex codes that unlock each new coin.",1
"china is the world leader in bitcoin mining, with miners deploying huge power-hungry computer server banks to crunch the necessary numbers—and moscow is eager to get into that business. putin aide dmitry marinichev predicts that ""russia has the potential to reach up to 30 percent share in global cryptocurrency mining in the future,"" which at current values would mean a $100 million annual market share for russia.",1
"the russian central bank is also exploring the use of cryptocurrency to help regulate the country's notoriously corrupt banking system, with dubious financiers frequently making loans to fake companies, then closing down, leaving the government to return depositors' money. cryptocurrencies are traceable, which would allow closer oversight of where a bank's money is going.",1
"it's the third reason for russia's interest in virtual currencies that has international law enforcement agencies worried: their use as money laundering tools. unlike with cash, all cryptocurrency transactions are recorded. that makes them perfectly trackable, so it's easy to monitor dealings between legitimate businesses. however, the problem is that ownership of virtual cash isn't necessarily attributable to people or businesses. and digital currency units can be anonymized by putting them through what's known as a tumbler, a service that changes the owner's identity by exchanging the tokens with ones belonging to other users also seeking anonymity. that gives virtual money the potential to become the perfect klepto-currency for anyone with shady motives—and it can be moved around the world with a few keystrokes.",1
"one of the most high-profile russian fans of cryptocurrencies is lawmaker and former kgb officer andrei lugovoi, the prime suspect in the fatal 2006 poisoning of former russian spy alexander litvinenko in london. lugovoi is one of dozens of russian officials and businessmen who are forbidden from traveling to or holding assets in europe or the united states. some have been the target of international sanctions because of their support of moscow's annexation of the crimea, or their role in the 2009 killing of anti-corruption lawyer sergei magnitsky, or, like lugovoi, their outstanding arrest warrants for crimes in the west. despite being a murder suspect in the u.k., lugovoi is deputy chair of the duma committee on security and anti-corruption—and in this role, he appeared at an april cryptocurrency forum in moscow to praise blockchain-based currencies. he argued that virtual money would allow russian companies—he tactfully didn't mention individuals—to get around western restrictions. ""this is a rare situation where the sanctions policy of the west gives rise to the opportunity for our own businesses to create something new,"" he said.",1
"russians have certainly been prolific at creating new—and often bizarre—cryptocurrencies. zrcoin, for instance, raised over $7 million from its ""initial coin offering"" (the crypto equivalent of an initial public offering) in april for a project to recover zirconium from industrial waste in magnitogorsk, russia. the value of each zrcoin is backed, says the company, by a kilogram of synthetic zirconium.",1
"many of these virtual currencies look like gimmicks. but money launderers are poised to take advantage of russia's cryptocurrency revolution too. the organized crime and corruption reporting project, a nongovernmental organization, recently updated its 2014 study titled ""the russian laundromat exposed"" to include the latest details of a vast and sophisticated network of offshore banks and shell companies that kremlin-connected oligarchs use to flout sanctions and park stolen money—so far, in conventional ways. between 2011 and 2017, the ngo reported, more than 20 russia-connected shell companies fired out 26,746 transfers to launder some $20.8 billion—through a single scheme.",1
"blockchain currencies could make that type of laundering much easier. virtual currencies ""are a potential nightmare for investigators,"" says one former u.s. law enforcement official with experience in moscow, who asked for anonymity because of his ongoing consulting work for government clients. ""it's pretty easy to trace how money goes from bank to bank. same for bitcoins…. you know what online entity owned them at what time. but [who] is behind that online identity? laundering is all about creating fake ownership. that's where cryptocurrency's anonymity becomes a problem.""",1
"it's a strange irony that both russian criminals and the government should favor cryptocurrencies—one as a means of money laundering, the other as a way to trace government money. but blockchain technologies are flexible enough to do both. the u.s. treasury and the russian central bank have announced plans to regulate the market, though it's not clear how new rules would control virtual currency trading conducted outside their national jurisdictions. ""the russians are drafting legislation, but that is laughable,"" says klimburg. ""the whole country is a massive money laundering and tax-evasion operation.""",1
blockchain technologies have other criminal applications too. they're a gold mine for hackers with access to giant networks of computers known as botnets. a bot is a computer that has been infected with a type of virus known as a trojan horse that allows the botnet's owner to remotely control the machine. botnets can number in the hundreds of thousands of machines and are normally used to generate enormous traffic that can crash websites. their disruptive power allows them to be weaponized to demand ransom money or wage political warfare.,1
"back in 2007, russian hackers showed the offensive capability of botnets for the first time when they attacked and briefly crashed much of tiny estonia's e-infrastructure. most recently, though, botnets have been put to a different use: stealing computer capacity to crack the codes of new bitcoins.",1
"legitimate bitcoin miners have to invest in expensive, power-hungry computer equipment and cut deals with power companies to buy their spare electricity. (russian energy giants gazprom and eurosibenergo recently announced that they were negotiating the sale of cheap megawatts to around 70 bitcoin-mining companies.) but bot masters simply steal that computing capacity by hijacking strangers' computers. the latest example was a group of hackers—""probably north korean actors based in china,"" according to klimburg—who in late april used a vulnerability in the windows operating system to create a botnet they used for bitcoin mining.",1
"that vulnerability—known in the trade as an ""exploit""—was most likely discovered by the u.s. national security agency as a hacking tool that could be used to get into computer systems via faults in programs. the exploit, dubbed ""eternalblue,"" was probably one of thousands of hacking tools stolen from the agency's highly sensitive tailored access operations by navy reservist harold martin iii, a former contractor for booz allen hamilton indicted in october 2016 for absconding with approximately 50 terabytes of secret hacks and other data from the nsa and cia. exactly how the eternalblue exploit got into the hands of a hacker group called shadow brokers—closely linked to russia's federal security service—isn't clear. but on april 14, hackers leaked the exploit code online, free for any hacker who wanted to use it. within two weeks, over 230,000 computers in 150 countries had been infected with viruses using eternalblue.",0
"the north korean bitcoin miners were the first to take advantage of this backdoor. but others soon followed, using eternalblue to distribute viruses called wannacry and notpetya. both so-called ransomware programs threatened to destroy the infected computer's system unless they received a payment in bitcoins. by may 12, wannacry had frozen large parts of the computer systems of britain's national health service, spain's telefónica, germany's deutsche bahn and fedex.",1
"cryptocurrencies may not be inherently dubious. but it's clear that there's a deep crossover between the worlds of hacking and the darker corners of the cryptocurrency world. as huge sums of money start to pour into the market—bitcoin grew 7.5 times in value over the past year alone, and ethereum's flagship token, the ether, was up 4,000 percent for the year earlier this summer—it is turning into a playground for brilliant entrepreneurs, risk-hungry investors and inventive criminals. russia, with its unique nexus of computer genius and money laundering expertise, looks set to become the new cryptocurrency world's wild east.",1

"blockchain comprises a digital network of blocks with a comprehensive ledger of transactions made in a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin or other altcoins.one of the signature features of blockchain is that it is maintained across more than one computer.  the ledger can be public or private (permissioned.) in this sense, blockchain is immune to the manipulation of data making it not only open but verifiable. because a blockchain is stored across a network of computers, it is very difficult to tamper with. the evolution of blockchainblockchain was originally invented by an individual or group of people under the name of satoshi nakamoto in 2008. the purpose of blockchain was originally to serve as the public transaction ledger of bitcoin, the world’s first cryptocurrency.in particular, bundles of transaction data, called “blocks”, are added to the ledger in a chronological fashion, forming a “chain.” these blocks include things like date, time, dollar amount, and (in some cases) the public addresses of the sender and the receiver.the computers responsible for upholding a blockchain network are called “nodes.” these nodes carry out the duties necessary to confirm the transactions and add them to the ledger. in exchange for their work, the nodes receive rewards in the form of crypto tokens.by storing data via a peer-to-peer network (p2p), blockchain controls for a wide range of risks that are traditionally inherent with data being held centrally.of note, p2p blockchain networks lack centralized points of vulnerability. consequently, hackers cannot exploit these networks via normalized means nor does the network possess a central failure point.in order to hack or alter a blockchain’s ledger, more than half of the nodes must be compromised. looking ahead, blockchain technology is an area of extensive research across multiple industries, including financial services and payments, among others.",1
"the term liquidity refers to the process, speed, and ease of which a given asset or security can be converted into cash. notably, liquidity surmises a retention in market price, with the most liquid assets representing cash.&nbsp;the most liquid asset of all is cash itself.&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in economics, liquidity is defined by how efficiently and quickly an asset can be converted into usable cash without materially affecting its market price.&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing is more liquid than cash, while other assets represent varying degrees of liquidity. this can be differentiated as market liquidity or accounting liquidity.·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;liquidity refers to a tangible construct that can be measures. the most common ways to do so include a current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio.&nbsp;what is the definition of liquidity?&nbsp;liquidity is a common definition used in investing, banking, or the financial services space. its primary function is to ascertain how quickly a given asset can be bought, sold, or exchanged without a disparity in market price.&nbsp;&nbsp;which of the following assets is the most liquid?&nbsp;by definition, in terms of liquidity, cash is unequivocally seen as the most liquid asset in an economic sense. this is due to its widespread acceptance and ease of conversion into other assets, forms of cash, or currencies, etc. all other liquid assets must be able to be quickly and efficiently converted into cash, i.e., financial liquidity. this includes such things as stocks, commodities, or virtually any other construct that has an associated value.&nbsp;by extension, illiquid or non-liquid assets are not able to be quickly converted into cash. these assets, also known as tangible assets, can include such things as rare art or collectables, real estate, etc.&nbsp;liquidity spectrum&nbsp;liquid assets can be defined primarily as either cash on hand or simply an asset that can be easily or readily converted into usable cash. it is important to note that cash is not uniformly liquid for several reasons. the below examples encompass all types of assets and their corresponding level of liquidity.&nbsp;examples of liquid assets or securities&nbsp;a good example of this is the us dollar, which is recognized or accepted globally, and backed by the us government or federal reserve bank. other major forms of cash include euros, or major currencies. this differs notably from the legal tender in many emerging countries or others for political or economic reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;cash aside, assets such as stocks or equities, bonds and other securities, money market assets, marketable securities, us treasuries or t-notes, exchange-traded funds (etfs), a savings account, and mutual funds serve as the most liquid assets. these are generally assumed to be quick assets.&nbsp;each of these assets can be converted into cash either instantaneously, or via any brokerage platform, exchange, etc., often in as little as minutes or seconds. as such, these assets are liquid.&nbsp;examples of illiquid assets or securities&nbsp;conversely, illiquid assets still retain importance and value, though are much more difficult to convert into cash. common examples of this include land or real estate, intellectual property, or other forms of capital such as equipment or machinery.&nbsp;in the examples above, liquid assets are assumed to be convertible into cash without substantial fees or delays in time. illiquid assets on the other hand often suffer from fees or additional conversion costs, processing times, ultimately creating a price disparity.&nbsp;the best example of an illiquid asset is a house. for many individuals this is the most valuable asset they will own in their entire lives. however, selling a house typically requires taxes, realtor fees, and other costs, in addition to time. real estate or land also takes much longer to exchange into cash, relative to other assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;types of liquidity&nbsp;overall, liquidity is a broad term that needs to be defined by two different measures: market liquidity and accounting liquidity. both measures deal with different constructs or entities entirely, though are useful metrics with regards to individuals or financial markets.&nbsp;market liquidity&nbsp;market liquidity is a broader term that is used by a market maker to measure the ease of which assets can be bought and sold at transparent prices, namely across exchanges, stock markets, or other financial sectors. this can include among others, a real estate or property market, market for fine arts and collectable, and other goods.&nbsp;market liquidity example&nbsp;as mentioned above, certain financial markets are much more liquid than others. the degree to which stocks from large companies or foreign currencies can be exchanged is much easier than finding a readily available market for antiques, collectables, or other capital, regardless of utility.&nbsp;overall, a stock market, financial brokerage, or exchange is considered to have the high market liquidity. this is because the difference between both the bid and ask prices between parties is very low. the lower the spread between these two prices, the more liquid a given market is. additionally, low liquidity refers to a higher spread between two prices.&nbsp;why liquidity varies and what does liquidity mean in stocks?&nbsp;every asset has a variable level of liquidity meaning this can change depending on what is being analyzed. one can define liquidity in stocks or stock markets in the same way as in foreign exchange markets, brokers, commodities exchanges, and crypto exchanges.&nbsp;&nbsp;additionally, how large the market is will also dictate liquidity. the foreign exchange market for example is currently the largest by trading volume with high liquidity due to cash flows. this is hardly surprising given that forms of cash or currencies are being exchanged.&nbsp;what is liquidity in stocks?&nbsp;a stock's liquidity refers to how rapidly shares of a stock can be bought or sold without largely impacting a stock price. by definition, liquidity in stocks varies for a number of reasons. stocks with low liquidity may be difficult to sell and may cause you to take a bigger loss if you cannot sell the shares when you want to. in finance, the most liquid assets are always the most popular.&nbsp;by extension, if a spread between buyers and sellers increases, the market is considered to be less liquid. a good example of this is the real estate or property market. while highly valuable, there are large disparities between the purchase price and selling price of property, as well as the time associated in making these transactions, and additional fees incurred by other parties. liquidity providers play a key role in this regard.&nbsp;accounting liquidity&nbsp;unlike market liquidity, accounting liquidity measures something different entirely. accounting liquidity is a measure by which either an individual or entity can meet their respective current financial obligations with the current liquid assets available to them. this includes paying off debts, overhead, or any other fixed costs associated with a business.&nbsp;accounting liquidity is a functional comparison between one’s current liquid assets and their current liabilities. in the united states and other countries, companies and individuals have to reconcile accounting on a yearly basis. accounting liquidity is an excellent measure that captures financial obligations due in a year.&nbsp;accounting liquidity example&nbsp;accounting liquidity itself can be differentiated by several ratios, controlling for how liquid assets are. these measures are useful tools for not just the individual or company in focus but for others that are trying to ascertain current financial health.as an example, accounting liquidity can measure any company’s current financial assets and compare them to its financial obligations. if there is a large disparity between these figures, or much more assets than obligations, a company can be considered to have a strong depth of liquidity.how to calculate liquidity&nbsp;liquidity is of importance to investors, financial market participants, analysts, or even for an investment strategy. calculating liquidity is a measure of firm or individual’s ability to utilize or harness current liquid assets to current cover short-term debt. this can be achieved using a total of four formulas: the current ratio, quick ratio, acid-test variation, and cash ratio.&nbsp;current ratio&nbsp;the current ratio is the easiest measure due to its lack of complexity. quite simply, the current ratio measures a firm or individual’s current assets or those than can be sold within a calendar year, weighed against all current liabilities.&nbsp;current ratio = current assets/current liabilities&nbsp;if the current ratio’s value is greater than 1, then the entity in question can be assumed to reconcile its financial obligations using its current liquid assets. highly liquid assets will correspond to higher numbers in this regard. conversely, any number less than 1 indicates that current liquid assets are not enough to cover short-term obligations.&nbsp;quick ratio&nbsp;a quick ratio is a slightly more complex way of measuring accounting liquidity via a balance sheet. unlike the current ratio, the quick ratio excludes current assets that are not as liquid as cash, cash equivalents, or other shorter-term investments. the quick ratio can be defined below by the following:&nbsp;quick ratio = (cash or cash equivalents + shorter-term investments + accounts receivable)/current liabilities&nbsp;acid-test ratio&nbsp;&nbsp;the acid-test ratio is a variation of the quick ratio. the acid-test ratio seeks to deduct inventory from current assets, serving as a traditionally broader measure that is more forgiving to individuals or entities.&nbsp;acid-test ratio = (current assets – inventories – prepaid costs)/current liabilities&nbsp;cash ratio&nbsp;finally, the cash ratio further isolates current assets, looking to measure only liquid assets that are designated as cash or cash equivalents. in this sense, the cash ratio is the most precise of the other liquidity ratios, excluding accounts receivable, inventories, or other assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;a more precise measure has its uses, namely regarding assessing financial strength in the face of an emergency, i.e., an unforeseen and time sensitive event. the cash ratio can help measure an entity or individual’s hypothesized solvency in the face of unexpected scenarios, events, etc. as such, the cash ratio is defined below:&nbsp;cash ratio = cash and cash equivalents/current liabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;the cash ratio is not simply a doomsday tool but a highly practical measure when determining market value. in the financial services space, even large companies or profitable institutions can find themselves at liquidity risk due to unexpected events beyond their control.&nbsp;why is liquidity important and why it matters to you?&nbsp;liquidity is very important for not just financial markets but for individuals and investors. liquid markets benefit all market participants and make it easier to buy and sell securities, stocks, collectables, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;on an individual level, this is important for personal finance, as ordinary investors are able to better take advantage of trading opportunities. additionally, high liquidity promotes financial health in companies in the same way it does for individuals.&nbsp;conclusion – what does liquidity mean?&nbsp;what is liquidity? this metric is a commonly used as a measure in the investing, banking, or financial services space. liquidity determines how quickly a given asset can be bought, sold, or exchanged without a disparity in market price.&nbsp;&nbsp;which of the following assets is the most liquid? – cash, stocks, real estate. of all assets, cash or money is the most liquid, meaning it is the easiest to utilize. all other liquid assets must be able to be quickly and efficiently converted into cash. this includes such things as stocks, commodities, or virtually any other construct that has an associated value.&nbsp;conversely, illiquid or non-liquid assets are not able to be quickly converted into cash. these assets, also known as tangible assets, can include such things as rare art or collectables, real estate, etc.&nbsp;frequently asked questions about liquidity&nbsp;is liquidity good or bad?&nbsp;the term liquidity refers to a measure and is neither good nor bad but is instead a metric of how convertible an asset is to cash. however, high liquidity is associated with lower risk, while a liquid stock is more likely to keep its value when being traded.is a home a liquid asset?&nbsp;a home or properly is not considered to be a liquid asset. selling any property can incur additional costs and take a long amount of time. additionally, there is often a price disparity from the time of purchase, meaning a seller may not even get its original market value back at the time of the sale.&nbsp;why are stocks liquid?&nbsp;stocks are some of the most liquid assets in financial markets because these assets can be converted to cash in a short period of time in the event of any financial emergency.&nbsp;is tesla a liquid stock?&nbsp;tesla is a liquid stock and while hugely volatile, is an integral part of the nasdaq and is a globally recognized company. additionally, the company is a popular single-stock cfd offering at many brokerages, with very high volumes.&nbsp;is a pension a liquid asset?&nbsp;certain pensions are liquid assets once you have reached a retirement age. until you are eligible to withdraw or collect a pension, without early withdrawal penalty, it is not considered a liquid asset.",1
"earlier this week, the blockchain transparency institute (bti) published a report alleging that wash trading in the cryptocurrency space has decreased by roughly 35 percent on the world’s 40 largest exchanges since the beginning of the year.",1
"however, quite a bit of wash trading still remains within the space. following the publishing of bti’s report, the website began experiencing a distributed denial of service attack, and has been inaccessible; it seems as though someone was not happy with the results of the report, and wants to hide it from the world.",1
"in fact, bti seemed to point the finger directly at news media outlet cointelegraph and cryptocurrency exchange okex, the latter of which was named as an exchange that persistently has (willingly or unwillingly) hosted wash trading.",1
"“sounds more like this was a timed attack to go along with the article,” bti wrote. “we are not surprised either, but we are still open to working with the okex team and will be sending them over data reports shortly to beef up their surveillance systems. many times we have found members of the upper management aren't even aware that one or some devs are allowing the wash trading to occur.”",1
"clearly, wash trading and false volume remain volatile and important issues. what is allowing the wash trading that remains in the space to persist? and what has been effective in reducing it?",1
"the primary reason behind this decline can be traced back to a single event. in march of this year, bitwise asset management published a presentation that it had delivered to the united states securities and exchange commission as part of its application to create a bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund (etf).",1
"in the report, bitwise claimed (among other things) to have identified 95 percent of all trading volume in the bitcoin market was artificially generated. for most industry participants, the claims came as a wake-up call; despite the fact that wash trading was recognized as a problem within the space, most of the industry did not recognize the extent of the problem.",1
"additionally, the major exchanges that were named as having wash trading on them in the bitwise report have taken their own steps to reduce the inauthentic volume on their platforms. after huobi was identified as having wash trading on its platform, the exchange updated its policies and perhaps rethought its relationships with some of the market makers it was working with.",1
"“we did identify a few of our market makers conducting what we suspect may have been wash trading for the sake of performance and marketing purposes,” huobi global ceo livio weng told coindesk through a spokesperson earlier this year. ""we have already communicated with these market makers and they have discontinued the strategies in question.”",1
"however, changpeng zhao, ceo of cryptocurrency exchange binance (which was also identified as an unwitting host for wash trading), told cryptoglobe that although his exchange is “fight[ing wash trading] very aggressively,” the problem does not have an easy solution.",1
"additionally, identifying exactly what constitutes wash trading and what does not is a difficult process: “if one trader buys from another trader and then sells back to that trader, from an exchange perspective, is that bad?” he asked.",1
"“and up to what limit do you say it’s wash trading? if you define it as two accounts trading against each other for $100k and then we freeze the account, what are they going to do? they’re gonna to go to $99k, and stop. so, it’s quite hard to fight and define this problem.”",1
"ram krishna rao, ceo  of marketorders, a blockchain-based gold and jewelry industry platform, told finance magnates that wash trading may have decreased because, from a perpetrator’s perspective, it simply isn’t as effective as it used to be--crypto investors aren’t as susceptible to hype and quick price movements as they once were.",1
"“it’s a lot easier to wash trade small market cap tokens than large market caps,” he said. “however, with investor sentiment on a decline, these small caps have noticed it’s an illegal and temporary solution and ultimately unless there’s developer growth, the outcome of the project will dwindle and the price will move proportionally to btc, almost all the time.”",1
"ceo and founder at credits blockchain company igor chugunov said that the cryptocurrency community is much more active about informing each other of wash trading than in the past, and that reputation is more important than ever: “projects and exchanges on which fictitious trading was noticed are added to the blacklist among crypto traders,” he told finance magnates.",1
"the bti pointed out that regulation may have had some effect on the decline in wash trading, pointing to the fact that a number of the exchanges with the least amount of wash trading were based in the united states and japan, two countries which have relatively more well-developed regulations on the financial and cryptocurrency industries.",1
"however, the report also noted that more regulation doesn’t necessarily mean effective regulation: “stricter regulatory frameworks do not always produce the cleanest exchanges,” it said. south korea was named specifically as an example of this.",1
the report also named crypto market data website coinmarketcap as a part of the problem. the platform came under fire following the bitwise report for not putting in enough effort to make its users aware that some of the volumes it was reporting may be false.,1
"the platform promised to develop better methods of recording and reporting more accurate volume--or at least flagging volume that is expected to be artificial. shortly after the bitwise report was released, the platform tweeted that “we are listening to all our users’ feedback, and we are working hard to add a suite of new metrics so users can get a fuller picture of exchanges and crypto on the site. what are some new metrics you would like to see? share with us. :)”s",1
we're working hard to build constructive solutions to address volume concerns. we look forward to more suggestions as we build out tools for our users. https://t.co/s9z0m8ohgt,0
"one thing that coinmarketcap did do was add a column for “adjusted volume” to its rankings, but forbes reported that “the numbers are almost entirely the same as ‘reported volume’ provided by the exchanges themselves.”",1
"nic carter, a partner at crypto investment fund castle island ventures, told the publication that the platforms pithy response was “like trying to put out a fire, a blazing house fire, by pouring a small cup of water on it.” finance magnates reached out to coinmarketcap for commentary but did not hear back before press time.",1
"wash trading is not unique to the cryptocurrency industry--the practice, which involves executing a high volume of artificial trades in order to drive up the perceived value of an asset--takes place in all kinds of financial marketplaces. for example, in july, the us commodities and futures trading commission fined the illinois-based eagle market makers, inc. $350,000 for engaging in wash trading in the derivatives market.",1
"in crypto, the motivation to participate wash trading is similar to the motivation to participate in wash trading in other markets: “the primary goal of wash trading is to artificially boost volumes either for a specific coin, token or exchange; the perceived effect of this being that the coin, token or exchange becomes more appealing for customers, traders and investors alike,” said peter wood, ceo of cryptocurrency trading platform coinburp, in an email to finance magnates.",1
"however, the cryptocurrency industry seems to have been affected far more severely than other types of financial markets. this is largely due to the fact that the cryptocurrency industry is relatively far less regulated or policed than other kinds of financial markets, in addition to the fact that a high percentage of smaller cryptocurrency exchanges have not developed tools and methods necessary to properly detect wash trading and stop it from happening.",1
"as such, coins with relatively smaller market caps are often targeted by scammers on these smaller exchanges. whereas a larger exchange may have a mechanism in place to notify its operators if an individual user or a small group of users is executing a large amount of buy and sell orders on a single asset in rapid succession, such behavior on a smaller exchange may go more or less unnoticed.",1
"when the price of the asset has been driven sky-high, and unwitting investors have been attracted accordingly, the entities that artificially pumped up the value of the asset will sell their holdings, leaving unsuspecting new buyers with a worthless asset--a classic pump-and-dump scheme.",1
"many smaller exchanges may even be doing some wash trading of their own, particularly in bitcoin markets: “wash trading is used by certain exchanges, generally smaller ones, to try and attract new users as they can show an increase in trading volume from their exchange,” explained shah in an email to finance magnates.",1
"this can create a sort of vicious cycle that ultimately negatively affects users: “this leads potential traders to their exchange in the guise that other traders are also going there or are utilizing that exchange due to factors such as faster transactions or better coin prices,” shah said. “it can also attract digital currency issuers to list on that exchange.”",1
and why should it matter to users that exchanges try to pump themselves up with fake volume? it’s not just a matter of principal--algoz ceo nir dovrat explained in an interview with finance magnates earlier this year that exchanges who appear to have high trading volumes fetch a high premium for listing new tokens.,1
"“if i’m an investor looking to invest in a crypto project…one of the most important things is that if i want to invest $1 million, i want to make sure that i can sell $1 million in the exchanges,” dovrat said. “but if all this volume is fake–and i just bought $1 million and the real volume is $5,000 per day, now i have a huge problem.",1
"shah said that there are several different methods: “one of the easiest ways to determine if an exchange is participating in wash trading is to compare the number of viewers on the exchange to the exchange’s trading volume. if there are large discrepancies, such as an extremely large trading volume per viewer, this indicates possible wash trading.”",1
"“another way is to compare the time it takes for an account/address to purchase and sell digital currency,” he added. “if the time is almost instantaneous, this could show the activity of a bot account which quickly buys and sells in order to increase the trading volume of an exchange – this can also be tied to a comparison of similar buy and sell orders from the same exchange as it is unusual for users of the same exchange to buy and sell the same amount of digital currencies at the same time, which is another indicator of bots.”",1
"finally, “several exchanges and groups have suggested potential mechanisms be put in place to prevent exchanges from participating in wash trading; although, it has yet to be seen if the smaller, unregulated exchanges will accept these suggestions and go the route of becoming a reputable exchange to compete with the larger ones.”",1
[ed note: investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.],1
"coinmarketcap reports approximately $6 billion per day in bitcoin trading volume, but the actual figure is $273 million, or roughly 4.5% of the reported amount, according to bitwise.",1
"when conducting its analysis, bitwise culled data from 81 exchanges, which it selected based on reported bitcoin trading volume. exchanges that reported less than $1 million worth of volume per day were excluded.",1
"however, ""most of the largest exchanges appear to have a much lower level of 'fake' volume, so the 95% number is hardly evenly spread across exchanges,"" he noted.",1
"other than simply wanting to make volume appear larger than it is for commercial reasons (the greater the volume, the easier it is to attract even more traders), three other factors may play into the motivations behind exaggerating volume: (1) the generalized decline in volume over the last 12 months or so, which makes appearing to be larger both more important and more difficult, (2) the growing volume on otc platforms, which both exacerbates and accelerates the first problem, and (3) the seemingly endless proliferation of new exchanges, meaning that more players are fighting for larger pieces of a shrinking pie.",1
"since digital currency exchanges are struggling to overcome these headwinds, and have significant incentive to inflate their trade volumes, investors may find that only a small number of these marketplaces provide reliable information.",1

"despite the launch of petro as its own national cryptocurrency, there is growing demand for bitcoin in venezuela. in march, a new record was set for bitcoin trading in venezuela, with a total value of over 1 trillion bolivares worth of btc changing hands. the country is plagued by massive inflation, which forces the venezuelan people to find secure ways of storing value.",0

"fincen said sanctioned russian and belarusian entities and individuals may try to evade sanctions in various ways, including through non-sanctioned russian and belarusian banks and financial institutions in third countries. some indicators of possible sanctions-evasion activity include the use of shell companies to obscure the ownership of entities or funds or to make international wire transfers.",1
"fincen said a variety of actors that still retain some access to the international financial system, including crypto exchanges and administrators inside or outside russia, could conduct evasion activities. for instance, crypto exchanges and administrators and other financial institutions could see attempted or completed transactions tied to crypto wallets or other activities associated with sanctioned russian and belarusian individuals or entities, fincen said.",1
"some red flags financial institutions and crypto firms should watch out for include transactions coming from or sent to an internet protocol, or ip, address located in russia or belarus, or from ip addresses already flagged as suspicious.",1
"a group of democratic senators last week voiced concern about the potential for cryptocurrencies to undermine u.s. sanctions against russia, and asked the treasury department to explain how it will mitigate the risk.",1
"fincen also warned financial institutions against possible russia-related ransomware attacks and other cybercrimes. some u.s. banks expressed concerns about retaliatory hacks from inside russia following the latest round of russia sanctions, the wall street journal previously reported. fincen said such red flags include customers initiating a transfer of funds using a virtual currency mixer that conceals the source or owner of the currency, according to the alert.",1
"the red flags pointed out by fincen, including one on the use of russian-associated ip addresses, indicate u.s. authorities want institutions to err on the side of reporting possible violations, according to                       braddock stevenson,          an attorney at law firm paul hastings llp who previously worked at fincen as deputy associate director of enforcement.",0

cryptocurrency devotees have a dream that one day humanity will be free from the yoke of money issued and control by governments through central banks.,1
"the venerable bank for international settlements, a 90-year-old institution based in switzerland, has issued a research report concluding that cryptocurrencies are afflicted with inherent contradictions that make their widespread use as money impossible.",1
"it is a unit of account that allows us to compare the prices of different goods and services; a medium of exchange that allows us to buy and sell these without having to organise swaps; and, finally, a store of value that allows us to save to buy things in the future.",1
"this is the first fundamental contradiction of cryptocurrencies — most of them generate trust by limiting the amount of currency available, in the case of bitcoin to 21 million.",1
"this is theoretically a good feature for the store of value function of money, as your savings theoretically cannot be debased by creating more of the currency.",1
"and it can backfire too for those trying to store value — just as there is no central bank to put downward pressure on the value of money, there's also no institution there to absorb potential losses and prop up the value of cryptocurrencies in times of crisis.",1
the second contradiction is that the very thing that gives money legitimacy — widespread acceptance and use — causes cryptocurrency transactions to become slower and more expensive.,1
"when demand for cryptocurrencies spikes, the cost of transactions increases dramatically as miners charge more for verifying them through the blockchains.",1
"""if you increase the capacity to the extent that it becomes costless to use the system, this will drive away the miners because there's no fees being paid,"" mr shin observed.",1
the second problem is the amount of data that needs to be both stored and transmitted to verify the blockchains in a distributed ledger handling millions of transactions a day.,1
"""with every transaction adding a few hundred bytes, the ledger grows substantially over time. for example, at the time of writing, the bitcoin blockchain was growing at around 50 gb per year and stood at roughly 170 gb,"" the report noted.",1
"to handle the volume of transactions that go through major global payment networks like visa, mastercard or paypal, you would quickly need banks of servers to store the data.",1
"""the associated communication volumes could bring the internet to a halt, as millions of users exchanged files on the order of magnitude of a terabyte.""",0
"""at the time of writing, the total electricity use of bitcoin mining equalled that of mid-sized economies such as switzerland, and other cryptocurrencies also use ample electricity.",1
"aside from these inherent contradictions, the bis also warns that cryptocurrencies remain more vulnerable to fraud and even potential debasement than currencies managed by responsible central banks.",1
"one way this can happen is through ""forking"", where one blockchain becomes split due to a change in protocol introduced by those with a majority of computing power.",1
"this can leave ""orphaned"" chains, or result in others continuing to add to the original pre-split chain, thus creating two diverging transaction records — effectively two currencies being born from one.",0
"""cryptocurrencies can be manipulated by miners controlling substantial computing power, a real possibility given the concentration of mining for many cryptocurrencies,"" cautioned the bis.",1
but the recent price collapse in many cryptocurrencies indicates that the bis is not alone in its scepticism of their long-term future as a widely accepted form of money.,1

"the bis says its goal was to look “beyond the hype” of bitcoin. what it found was a currency-like system that can’t handle a scaling up of transactions, can’t provide the trustworthiness required for a functioning currency, and requires so much computing power to keep track of exchanges that it already has become “an environmental disaster.”",1
"that’s just for starters. the bis report, which is a chapter in the institution’s annual report, comes against a backdrop that includes a six-month price collapse, government enforcement actions against alleged cryptocurrency frauds and reports of hackings costing bitcoin owners the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars in the blink of an eye.",1
"you can expect the bitcoin faithful to dismiss the bis report as the incumbent central banking establishment trying to bring down a challenge to its primacy. it’s true that the bank is part of that establishment. often described as the central bank for central banks, the bis acts as a counterparty and agent for central banks in their transactions. but its duties also include policy analysis and research of interest to those member banks; producing an inaccurate or unfair analysis of a rival marketplace wouldn’t be much of a service for those members.",0
"the bis report includes a precis on the definition and role of money — worth a read by bitcoin fans and skeptics alike. as it observes, a functioning monetary system must comprise three features — a “unit of account” that allows price comparisons for goods and services, a medium of exchange accepted as payment by buyers and sellers alike, and a store of value that remains stable over time — the money in your bank account, wallet or mattress shouldn’t fluctuate widely.",1
"no such systems are perfect, the bis acknowledges. indeed, the british museum devotes a whole room to the stones, shells, coins, paper and other objects that once served all those three roles and fell out of favor. nor is government-issued currency immune from abuse, as is plain from the experiences of the weimar-era german mark and today’s debasement of the currency of venezuela. but the central bank systems that sprung up in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and were refined in the aftermath of the great depression were responses to such crises.",0
"that system is unsustainable, the bis says. the electrical use devoted to mining bitcoin alone already equals that of switzerland: “the quest for decentralized trust has quickly become an environmental disaster.”",1
there are other grounds to doubt whether bitcoin can grow large enough to serve financial transactions on anything like a global scale. for bitcoin to verify transactions on the scale of visa or mastercard systems today would require supercomputers and “communication volumes [that] could bring the internet to a halt.”,1
"bis acknowledges that some technologists believe that the technology underlying bitcoin, known as blockchain technology, could have more value for central banks or international financial systems than bitcoin itself. it’s skeptical. tests by some central banks have experimented with such systems, successfully. “however,” it finds, “the results have not been clearly superior to existing infrastructures.”",1
"bis has done a service for finance professionals in providing a baseline judgment of whether bitcoin is worth serious consideration as an asset class at a time when investment banks such as goldman sachs are offering clients access to the market. the banks appear to be responding to their clients’ wishes. but whether they’re actually providing those clients with a worthwhile service is a different question, and bis suggests the answer may be no.",1

"bitcoin and other such instruments aspire to the three roles of money, but can’t deliver, bis says. although the systems ostensibly incorporate safeguards against counterfeiting, no central authority stands behind them as a trusted counterparty. nor do they have intrinsic value. “this makes them akin to a commodity money” like gold or rice or south sea stones, bis says. “their value derives only from the expectation that they will continue to be accepted by others.”",1

"cryptocurrency’s warning signs having been coming fast and furious. a new report indicates that half of initial coin offerings, which are the crypto world’s money-raising equivalent of an ipo, have already died—and many of the remaining are blatant scams with no intent to build a product. then there are the crypto-rich stories that shouldn’t pass a basic smell test of reasonability and logic. just look at ripple. in early january, ripple co-founder chris larsen had a net worth of $59 billion, moving him ahead of facebook’s mark zuckerberg, the co-founders of google, and the founder of oracle. but following a crypto crash in mid january, larsen had lost $44 billion of his net worth. gravity can be a heartache.",1
"then you have the mythology surrounding satoshi nakamoto, the anonymous listed inventor of bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology. a mysterious character who creates 880,000 bitcoins of dubious value whose value is propped up by a public enthralled by stories of newly minted crypto millionaires? that’s not going to end well. throw in a twist where one person allegedly manipulated prices on the mt. gox currency exchange to drive the price from $150 to $1,000, and it all sounds like a hollywood film. the red flags are right out there in the open, waving in the wind.",1
"despite the damn-the-man libertarian framing of cryptocurrency as the great democratizer of wealth, just 1,000 people own 40% of the entire bitcoin market (which was valued at over $200 billion in early 2018, and now hovers somewhere over $100 billion depending on the massive daily fluctuations).",1
"broadly defined, multi-level marketing schemes work by creating a structure where people are recruited and then incentivized to recruit new members. nutritional-supplement seller herbalife and cosmetics company mary kay are two prime examples. the more people who buy into the concept down the line, the more that the individuals at the top make, hence the closely related pyramid-scheme synonym. a participant’s livelihood therefore depends on recruiting new believers, and the proselytizers who were around from the early days deemphasize the associated risks. eventually too many people try to join the bottom and the middle bricks begin falling out—but not before the early adopters are able to make an exorbitant amount of money.",1
"isn’t this exactly what is happening in the cryptocurrency world? those who bought in early have an incredibly strong interest to recruit new “members”: the more people who buy crypto, the higher the prices become, and the thicker the owners’ digital wallets get. as the field goes mainstream, their current holdings will spike in value, especially given the fact that many cryptocurrencies trade with small volume. but eventually the hype will die down, and the latecomers will shoulder the brunt.",1
"the thought of making easy money, especially after seeing others around you make money, triggers people to suspend their typical reasoning. looking to capitalize on this moment of suspended logic, new cryptocurrencies are multiplying like gremlins. there are currently 1,519 cryptocurrencies available to purchase, many of which are listed at well under a penny. (but if that penny goes up to a dime, someone makes a lot of money.)",1
"much like your essential-oil obsessive cousin who finally sees through their pyramid scheme’s shiny facade, a light is beginning to shine on crypto harpers. respected investor and currency trader george soros said at the recent world economic forum that “bitcoin is not a currency.” likewise, warren buffet is skeptical: “i can say almost with certainty that [cryptocurrencies] will come to a bad ending,” he told cnbc in january. an eu commission has just stated that cryptocurrencies are not a currency and do not have guaranteed value. even the north american bitcoin conference stopped accepting bitcoin as payment to its own conference.",1
"yet true believers are still undeterred. we have seen this mass delusion play out before, and you don’t have to go back to the tulip mania of 1636-1637 to see it. the late 1990s featured a mania around beanie babies, where adults spent thousands of dollars for plush toys made in china. their price continued to rise based on the belief that the beanie babies had turned into a new type of asset, and lots of people lost major savings. but still, there was a winner: creator ty warner is currently worth $2.7 billion.",0
"in a similar fashion, cryptocurrencies are minting millionaires and billionaires because they are convincing down-the-line participants that there is easy money at the end of the rainbow. the newness and complex technical nature of cryptocurrency masks a multilevel-marketing strategy we have seen perpetuated throughout history—except instead of slinging beauty products or protein powders, we’re now buying invisible coins.",1

the spread of bitcoins is now prompting regulators in scandinavia to draft new rules in an effort to prevent virtual money from slipping into a legal gray zone.,1
"the most likely outcome would be an “amendment to existing financial legislation so that we have regulation covering it,” michael landberg, chief legal adviser at the financial supervisory authority in denmark, said yesterday in a phone interview. “it is also important to have this included in money laundering acts.”",1
"more and more nations are taking an official stance on virtual currencies that aren’t controlled by any government or central bank. norway said this month it won’t recognize bitcoins as legal tender and will impose a capital gains tax. prices sank as much as 35 percent today after china’s largest bitcoin operator, btc china, said a third-party payment provider gave notice it will no longer provide deposit services. that followed a move by china’s central bank to bar financial institutions and payment companies from handling bitcoin transactions.",1
"“there are clearly issues that need to be solved on the use of bitcoins,”benny engelbrecht, spokesman for denmark’s ruling social democrats on the parliament committee overseeing financial regulation, said in an interview. “there’s clearly a need to regulate bitcoins and other virtual currencies; it’s not something we can do on our own. it has to be done on the european level and globally.”",1
"since their introduction in 2008, bitcoins have spread rapidly, with about 12 million in circulation, according to bitcoincharts. they’re now used to pay for everything from hand-made rugs to window cleaning.",1
"“we’ll seek to follow the mainstream,” landberg said. “bitcoins are not forbidden in the u.s. and the u.k. it is out there and will continue to be out there. it just needs to be regulated. the challenge for us is how to do that.”",1
"because denmark’s fsa doesn’t currently have the legal authority to prevent trade using bitcoins, it was unable to stop an entity from “establishing itself in this country with the intention of operating a company that exchanges real currencies against so-called virtual currencies, among others, bitcoins,” the regulator said yesterday, without identifying the firm.",1

"crypto enthusiasts have long pondered who the largest owners of bitcoin are since the early days of the its existence. it can be especially difficult to determine the concentration of ownership, as many of the largest addresses don’t often represent individuals, but exchanges and other entities that hold bitcoin on behalf of other investors.",1
"however, by using a data collection method that differentiated between addresses belonging to intermediaries and individuals, nber researchers were able to find the former controlled about 5.5 million bitcoin at the end of last year while the latter controlled about 8.5 million. additionally, the top 1,000 individual investors controlled about 3 million, and the concentration could be even greater.",1
"for instance, the data did not not assign the ownership of early bitcoins held in about 20,000 addresses to one person (satoshi nakamoto) and considered them as belonging to 20,000 different individuals.",1
"the concentration of miners is even more profound, data show. nber found that the top 10% of miners control 90% of the bitcoin mining capacity, and just 0.1% (about 50 miners) control 50% of mining capacity.",1
"such a high concentration could make the bitcoin network vulnerable to a 51% attack, where a colluding set of miners or one miner is able to take control of a majority of the network. nber found the concentration also decreases following sharp increases in the bitcoin price, meaning the probability the network is vulnerable to a 51% attack is higher when bitcoin’s price drops sharply.",1
"bitcoin surged to $40,000 for the first time, doubling in value in less than a month and pushing the total market value of cryptocurrencies beyond $1 trillion.",1

"“bitcoin continues to defy all expectations, and doubters,” said antoni trenchev, co-founder and managing partner of nexo, a crypto lender. “it’s leaving all other assets trailing in its wake, like it’s done year in, year out for the past decade.”",1
"digital coins are jumping in a world awash with fiscal and monetary stimulus, even as some commentators fear an inevitable bust and others question the basic integrity of crypto markets. proponents of bitcoin argue it offers a hedge against dollar weakness and the risk of faster inflation, a bit like gold, while critics decry the intellectual soundness of comparing the two assets.",1

"active bitcoin accounts are nearing their all-time high levels of late 2017, according to researcher flipside crypto — possibly a sign that some holders are planning to sell. fewer than 2% of accounts hold 95% of bitcoin supply, so a few big trades can impact prices. the last big bitcoin boom began imploding in late 2017.",1
"some traders pointed to jpmorgan chase & co.’s long-term bitcoin price forecast of $146,000 as possibly fueling the rally. others said sentiment was boosted by a u.s. regulatory update that allows a class of less volatile coins to be used by banks for payments.",1
"many industry players expressed concern at the time that the prices were being pushed up at least partly by activity at bitfinex, one of the largest and least regulated exchanges in the industry. the exchange, which is registered in the caribbean with offices in asia, was subpoenaed by american regulators shortly after articles about the concerns appeared in the new york times and other publications.",1
"more from the new york times:worries grow that the price of bitcoin is being propped upbitcoin falls below $10,000 as virtual currency bubble deflatesas bitcoin scrapes $10,000, an investment boom like no other",1
"mr. griffin looked at the flow of digital tokens going in and out of bitfinex and identified several distinct patterns that suggest that someone or some people at the exchange successfully worked to push up prices when they sagged at other exchanges. to do that, the person or people used a secondary virtual currency, known as tether, which was created and sold by the owners of bitfinex, to buy up those other cryptocurrencies.",1
"""there were obviously tremendous price increases last year, and this paper indicates that manipulation played a large part in those price increases,"" mr. griffin said.",1
bitfinex executives have denied in the past that the exchange was involved in any manipulation. the company did not respond to a request for comment this week.,1
"the authors of the new 66-page paper do not have emails or documents that prove that bitfinex knew about or was responsible for price manipulation. the researchers relied on the millions of transaction records that are captured on the public ledgers of all virtual currency transactions, known as the blockchain, to spot patterns. this method is not conclusive, but it has helped government authorities and academics spot suspicious activity in the past.",1
"in particular, mr. griffin and mr. shams examined the flow of tether, a token that is supposed to be tied to the value of the dollar and that is issued exclusively by bitfinex in large batches. they found that half of the increase in bitcoin's price in 2017 could be traced to the hours immediately after tether flowed to a handful of other exchanges, generally when the price was declining.",0
"other large virtual currencies that can be purchased with tether, such as ether and zcash, rose even more quickly than bitcoin in those periods. the prices rose much more quickly on exchanges that accepted tether than they did on those that did not, and the pattern ceased when bitfinex stopped issuing new tether this year, the authors found.",1
"philip gradwell, the chief economist at chainalysis, a firm that analyses blockchain data, also said the study ""seems credible."" he cautioned that a full understanding of the patterns would require more analysis.",0
"mr. griffin previously wrote research pointing to fraudulent behavior in several other financial markets. he drew attention for a 2016 paper that suggested that a popular financial contract tied to the volatility in financial markets, known as the vix, was being manipulated. a whistle-blower later came forward to confirm those suspicions, and now several active lawsuits are focused on the allegations.",1
"beyond his work at the university of texas, mr. griffin has a consulting firm that works on financial fraud cases, including some in the virtual currency industry.",1
"""the relationship between tether and the price of bitcoin has been flagged for months within the community,"" said christian catalini, a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology who specializes in blockchain research. ""it is great to see academic work trying to causally assess if market manipulation is taking place.""",1
"the new paper is not the first academic work to identify manipulation in the virtual currency markets. a paper published last year by a team of israeli and american researchers said much of bitcoin's big price increase in 2013 was caused by a campaign of price manipulation at what was then the biggest exchange, mt. gox.",1

"so, what’s an nft? an nft is a unit of data stored on a blockchain that certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable, while offering a unique digital certificate of ownership for the nft3. more broadly, an nft allows to establish the “provenance” of the assigned digital object, offering indisputable answers to such questions as who owns, previously owned, and created the nft, as well as which of the many copies is the original. several types of digital objects can be associated to an nft including photos, videos, and audio. nfts are now being used to commodify digital objects in different contexts, such as art, gaming, and sports collectibles. originally nfts were part of the ethereum blockchain but increasingly more blockchains have implemented their own versions of nfts4.",1
"the first popular example of nfts is cryptokitties, a collection of artistic images representing virtual cats that are used in a game on ethereum that allows players to purchase, collect, breed, and sell them on ethereum5. in december 2017, cryptokitties congested the ethereum network6. by many considered a chief example of the irrationality driving the cryptocurrency market in 20177, cryptokitties remained the only popular example of nfts for almost 2 years. in july 2020, the nft market started to grow2 and attracted a huge attention in march 2021, when the artist known as beeple sold an nft of his work for $69.3 million at christie’s8. the purchase resulted in the third-highest auction price achieved for a living artist, after jeff koons and david hockney9. several other record sales followed10,11: three cryptopunks—a collection of 10,000 unique automatically generated digital characters—were sold at $11.8, $7.6, and $7.6 million dollars, respectively; the first tweet was sold at $2.9 million dollars; and the auction winner picks name, an nft with music video and dance track, sold at $1.33 million dollars. the profitability of nfts has motivated celebrities to create their own nfts, with collectibles of nba and famous football players getting sold for hundreds of thousands dollars12.",1
"we break down our analysis by nft categories, which are classified by manual inspection, with references to the classification proposed by nonfungible corporation24, a specialized company that track nfts sales, and opensea25, one of the largest nft marketplace. however, the exact classification of different categories in which nfts are used is outside of the scope of the present paper. for example, art objects can be in some cases classified as collectibles, while some game objects may present sophisticated aesthetic and cultural properties that may qualify them as art.",1
"items exchanged on the nft market are organized in collections, sets of nfts that, in most cases, share some common features. collections can be widely different in nature, from sets of collectible cards, to selections of art masterpieces, to virtual spaces in online games. most collections can be categorised in six categories: art, collectible, games, metaverse, other, and utility (see also “si”). we show the top 5 collections in terms of number of unique assets (n) for each category (see fig. 1a).",1
description of the nft landscape. (a) top 5 nfts collections (by number of assets) organized by category. the size of each circle is proportional to the number of assets in each collection. (b) daily volume (in usd) exchanged over time for each category and for all assets (see legend). days with volume below 1000 usd are not shown. (c) share of volume traded by category. (d) share of transactions by category. results in these panels are averaged over a rolling window of 30 days.,0
"temporal patterns of secondary sales are unique for each collection, as evidenced by considering the top collection in each category (see fig. 3). for example, when cryptokitties emerged in 2017, secondary sale prices were typically lower than the price of their first sale. more recently in 2021, instead, their secondary sale prices have gone up because of an increase in the number of potential customers. other collections, like alien, alternated periods when secondary sale prices went down and period when they went up. in the unstoppable collection secondary sales are rare because nfts correspond to web domains secured by blockchain technology. in 2017, secondary sale price were lower than primary in 66% of the cases, while in 2021 only 27% of secondary sales had lower prices than the primary one.",1
"secondary sale prices. sales over time for the top collection in terms of number of sales in each nft category (cryptokitties, stf.capcorn, alien, decentraland, miscellanea, and unstoppable). each horizontal line represents an nft and each dot a sale. sales are coloured based on the change in price compared to previous sale (see colourbar).",1
"how do traders interact with each other? are there central actors? we approach these questions adopting a network science approach23,27. we consider the network of trades, where nodes are traders, a directed link from a trader to another exists if the former (the buyer) purchases at least one nft from the latter (the seller). each link has a weight corresponding to the total number of items that the buyer bought from the seller.",1
"key network properties. (a) pdf of the traders’ strength. (b) traders’ strength as a function of the number of days of activity. (c) percentage of transaction traders make toward their top and second-top nft collections. (d) pdf of the nfts’ strength. (e) percentage of transactions between nfts in different collections as a function of the size of the collection. (f) percentage of nfts belonging to the first and second largest strong connected component (scc). solid curves in (b), (c), (e) and (f) represent average values, while respective bands the 95% confidence interval.",1
"we now turn to the exploration of how nfts are connected to one another. to this end, we construct the network of nfts, where nodes are nfts and a directed link exists between two nfts that are purchased “in sequence”, e.g. a link is created from an nft to another when a buyer purchases the former and then the latter, with no purchases between the two (see “si” for more details). rather than linking all nfts ever traded by the same trader, this choice allows to understand the relations between nft that are semantically similar, because they are bought by the same trader in approximately the same period of time. further, it ensures that the network structure is not dominated by large cliques.",0
"a visual representation of the trader network including the art category on february 2021 shows the clusters formed by nft traders specialized in the same collection (see fig. 5a). similarly, the same visualization for the nft network shows a similar trend, where nfts, albeit surrounded by other nfts in the same collection, tend to form a sparser structure (see fig. 5b).",0
"networks visualization. (a) trader network, where nodes represent traders and links sales between a pair of them. (b) nft network, where nodes represent nfts and links when a pair of nfts is purchased in “sequence”. for visualization purposes, we selected the ten top collections in the art category on february 2021. visualization is done using netwulf31.",1
"we then study the networks consisting of assets in the same category and blockchain (see “si”). we find that key results presented above, including the shape of the strength distributions, hold across categories. also in this case, we find that traders, independently from the category considered, are specialized: the fraction of individual trades in the top collection is included between 59%, for the other category, and 98%, for the utility category. similarly, the fraction of individual trades in the top collection is 70% for the wax blockchain and 91% for the ethereum blockchain category. relative to the number of total nfts in each category, the wax component contains 55.0% of all nfts labeled as collectible, but only the 0.06% of all nfts labeled as utility. on the contrary, the ethereum component has the 54.8% of all art, but only the 10.6% of games.",0
"visual features representation. (a) cosine distance of graphical digital objects between items grouped by collections and categories (coloured bands on the right), recognising aesthetical similarities and uniformity between and within these groups. for visualization purposes, we selected the largest 98 collections in our dataset. (b) the dimensionality reduction of alexnet vectors by pca and their visualization in the pc1, pc2 and pc3 space, broken down by nft categories, demonstrate the presence of graphically uniform clusters. for visualization purposes, we downsampled the digital objects associated with the cryptokitties and sorare collections, which alone constitute the 61% of the whole dataset.",1
"to map the images into a lower-dimensional feature space that can be used in practice for prediction and visualization, we apply principal component analysis (pca) to the alexnet vectors. pca uses linear combinations of the 4096-dimensional vectors to project them into vectors with an arbitrarily lower number of dimensions and such that the variance of datapoints in the projected space is maximized. considering the whole sample, which consists of about 1.25 million graphical objects, the first five principal components explain together about the 38.3% of the total variance, progressively distributed from pc1 to pc5 as follow: 20.3%, 7.3%, 4.0%, 3.8% and 2.7%. the pc1 to pc5 scores are used to test the capacity of visual features for predicting sales (see next subsection), while pc1, pc2, and pc3 for visually representing the data through a 3d scatter plot and showing intra-categories homogeneity (see fig. 6b). this can be quantified by looking at the average euclidean distance in the pc1, pc2, pc3 space between objects of the same category and comparing it to the one calculated among objects of different categories. considering the whole sample and calculating the distance between all the points, the average value obtained between elements of different categories is 1.67 bigger than for elements of the same category. however, as we already described for the cosine distance in the alexnet vector space, this is mainly due to the intra-collections homogeneity, as demonstrated calculating the average inter-collection distance which results more than three times (3.17) bigger than the intra-collection distance and secondarily to the presence of intra-categories clusters of similar looking collections. this is most likely caused by the market responsiveness to the success of a collection, which induces other creators to follow the trend and offer variations on the theme.",1
"the nft market is less than four years old and has boomed in 2021. this paper presented the first overview of some key aspects of it by looking at the market history of 6.1 million nft trades across six main nft categories including art, games and collectibles. in brief, (1) we analyzed the main properties of the market, (2) we built and studied the traders and nfts networks and found that most traders are specialised, (3) we showed that nft collections tend to be visually homogeneous, and (4) we explored the predictability of nft prices revealing that, while past history is as expected the best predictor, also nft specific properties, such as the visual features of the associated digital object, help increase predictability.",1
"it is important to highlight the main limitations of our study, which represent also directions for future work. first, we gathered data from a variety of online nft marketplaces and not directly from the ethereum or wax blockchains, so that we have likely missed a number of “independent” nft producers. second, we mostly adopted an accepted categorisation for the nfts, which includes a number of arbitrary decisions and could however be further refined (as every categorization). third, since our primary goal was to provide a general overview of the market, we did not extensively explore all the available methods e.g., for the features extraction from images33 and their clustering in a lower-dimensional space34, machine learning for price prediction35, or market modelling36. we also did not consider collective attention as measured e.g. from social media or wikipedia, which can be a further source of information about market behaviour37,38,39. fourth, we considered mostly the ethereum and wax blockchains, but several other platforms offer smart contracts and nfts. finally, our price prediction exercise did not include information about the creator of the (digital) object associated to the nfts. while this is due mainly to the dataset, and in many cases the identity of the creator is not available or does not exist (e.g., for ai generated images), it is likely that in certain contexts, and specifically for art, this can be an important aspect to consider.",1
"overall, nfts are a new tool that satisfies some of the needs of creators, users, and collectors of a large class of digital and non-digital objects. as such, they are probably here to stay or, at least, they represent a first step towards new tools to deal with property and provenance of such assets. we anticipate that our study will help accelerate new research on nft in a broad array of disciplines, including economics, law, cultural evolution, art history, computational social science, and computer science. the results will also help practitioners make sense of a rapidly evolving landscape and inform the design of more efficient marketplaces as well as the associated regulation.",0
"our dataset includes only transactions representing purchases of nfts, whose ownership change following that transaction. we exclude from our analysis any transactions representing the minting of nfts or bids during an auction. we track different cryptocurrencies. etherum blockchain data for the collections superrare, makersplace, knownorigin, cryptopunks, and asyncart were shared by nonfungible corporation24, a company that tracks historical nft sales data to build nft valuations. other ethereum blockchain data were downloaded from four open-source apis: cryptokitties sales40, gods-unchained41, decentraland42, and opensea43. with opensea that allows trading in multiple cryptocurrencies. we also monitored the wax blockchain, through tracking transactions in the atomic api44.",1
"we group nfts into six categories: art consisting of digital artworks such as images, videos, or gifs; collectible representing items of interest to collectors; games including digital object used in competitive games; metaverse consisting of pieces of virtual worlds; utility representing items having a specific function; and other including the remaining collections. more details on the nft categorization are explained in “si”. the final, cleaned dataset includes 935 million usd traded in 6.1 million transactions involving 4.7 million nfts grouped in 4624 collections. our dataset includes transactions in 160 different cryptocurrencies with most of them made in wax (52% of the total number of transactions), while the volume in usd is mostly eth (81% of the total volume). we show general statistics of the categories of nfts considered, involving a total of 359,561 buyers, 314,439 sellers, trading 4.7 millions nfts involving 953 million usd in cryptocurrencies (see “si”).",1

"the move, a significant step for the acceptance of bitcoin as an asset class, was made by morgan stanley after clients demanded exposure to the cryptocurrency, said the people, who declined to be identified sharing details about the bank's internal communications. bitcoin's rally in the past year has put wall street firms under pressure to consider getting involved in the nascent asset class.",1
"but, at least for now, the bank is only allowing its wealthier clients access to the volatile asset: the bank considers it suitable for people with ""an aggressive risk tolerance"" who have at least $2 million in assets held by the firm.",1

"venmo is adding support for cryptocurrency, starting today. the company says it will begin to roll out the ability for venmo’s more than 70 million users to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies directly in the app, similar to the support venmo parent company paypal added late last year. initially, venmo will support four types of cryptocurrency: bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and bitcoin cash — the same that paypal offers its u.s. users.",1
"though there isn’t much differentiation between what both paypal and venmo offers users today, the company explains that the move is more about getting cryptocurrencies in front of a separate, and arguably younger, audience.",1
"“while there is some overlap between the bases, there are also a lot of customers who are discretely either paypal or venmo users,” explains darrell esch, venmo general manager and svp. “so this ultimately gives us a new group of customers who aren’t using paypal day in and day out the ability to access [crypto] through venmo.”",1
"he says that venmo skews younger, with more of its users in their 20s and 30s, compared with the overall u.s. population. they also have other traits that might make them receptive to investing in cryptocurrencies. for example, they’re more likely than the overall u.s. population to have a college degree, they’re solidly middle-income earners and they skew toward digital natives.",1
"the user base has also already begun purchasing crypto, venmo notes. more than 30% had purchased crypto or equities, according to a 2020 venmo customer study. this picked up during the pandemic, as well.",1
"at launch, venmo will leverage its in-app social feed to spread the word about cryptocurrencies. users can share their crypto transactions to the feed, if they choose. this will raise awareness and engagement with the idea of crypto, as will venmo’s new educational features. the company says it plans to publish access guides and videos inside the app that will help to answer some of the common questions about cryptocurrencies for those who are just getting started. (see below video, for example.)",1
"meanwhile, although paypal announced its u.s. customers could shop with cryptocurrencies via its supported merchant base, venmo doesn’t immediately have a similar option. however, the company as of february rolled out to its user base a feature called business profiles, which enables venmo users to transact with small sellers and merchants on its app. it’s not difficult to imagine the role that crypto could play here, as well, in the future. venmo also offers other products, including a debit and credit card, which could also be leveraged in the future to take advantage of a crypto integration, perhaps.",1
"but in the meantime, the only way to use crypto on venmo is by buying, selling and holding. the company says users can start with as little as a dollar and pay via their linked bank account or debit card. of note, the venmo wallet doesn’t connect with that of parent company paypal, though we understand the exchange rates will be the same.",1

"interest in bitcoin has remained high as the original cryptocurrency surged this year, hitting a record price above $60,000 this month. u.s. regulators have allowed the fund industry to offer bitcoin-linked etfs for the first time this month, while big institutional investors like bond giant pimco have said they were considering trading crypto.",1
"that interest has led mastercard clients to ask the network for help in providing crypto services, according to haymond. that way, banks can keep customers on their own platforms rather than seeing dollars migrate to crypto exchanges, she said.",1
"shares of bakkt, which began trading as a public company last week, surged an incredible 234% on the news. mastercard and bakkt were set announce their partnership later monday at the annual money20/20 conference in las vegas.",1
"besides providing crypto wallets and credit cards for banks, the partnership means that even merchants and restaurants can begin to offer rewards in bitcoin instead of traditional points, according to bakkt ceo gavin michael. existing points can be converted into crypto at rates set by the participating companies, giving customers the ability to earn a yield, he said.",1
"""we're lowering the barriers to entry, allowing people to take something like your rewards points and trade them into crypto,"" michael said in an interview.

"the ‘mining’ process for the cryptocurrency bitcoin is power hungry, and is increasing its environmental impact as its price and popularity rise. cryptocurrencies are generated by specialized software, used to solve complex mathematical problems that represent proof-of-work algorithms in exchange for electronic coins (see https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).",1
"some estimate that the combined electricity consumption for bitcoin and ethereum mining, which together represent 88% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization (g. hileman and m. rauchs http://doi.org/cj22; 2017), has already reached a staggering 47 terawatt-hours per year and is on the rise (see www.digiconomist.net). to put this into perspective, greece’s population of 11 million consumes close to 57 terawatt-hours annually.",1
"moreover, 58% of all cryptocurrency mining is done in china and is typically powered by coal plants. using the life-cycle impact-assessment methodology, i estimate that the annual carbon footprint for bitcoin and ethereum mining is comparable to that of some 6.8 million average european inhabitants — or as much as 43.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (see recipe and ipcc 2013 methods, respectively, at go.nature.com/2nn7zzj).",1
"there are now hundreds of cryptocurrencies in existence and the technological backbone of many of these currencies is blockchain—a digital ledger of transactions. the competitive process of adding blocks to the chain is computation-intensive and requires large energy input. here we demonstrate a methodology for calculating the minimum power requirements of several cryptocurrency networks and the energy consumed to produce one us dollar’s (us$) worth of digital assets. from 1 january 2016 to 30 june 2018, we estimate that mining bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and monero consumed an average of 17, 7, 7 and 14 mj to generate one us$, respectively. comparatively, conventional mining of aluminium, copper, gold, platinum and rare earth oxides consumed 122, 4, 5, 7 and 9 mj to generate one us$, respectively, indicating that (with the exception of aluminium) cryptomining consumed more energy than mineral mining to produce an equivalent market value. while the market prices of the coins are quite volatile, the network hashrates for three of the four cryptocurrencies have trended consistently upward, suggesting that energy requirements will continue to increase. during this period, we estimate mining for all 4 cryptocurrencies was responsible for 3–15 million tonnes of co2 emissions.",1
"decentralized cryptocurrencies represent a potentially revolutionary new technology for securely transferring money or information from one entity to another1,2,3,4. many cryptocurrencies utilize blockchain, a public ledger, to accurately and continuously record transactions among many decentralized nodes5. a process of consensus, or agreement, is performed by ‘miners’ through repetitive calculations using specialized computer hardware. the first miner to determine the correct ‘answer’ adds a new block to the chain and is rewarded for this energy-intense calculation with several newly generated coins6. the primary purpose of this competitive mining is to maintain the integrity of the decentralized blockchain by facilitating the many millions of transactions occurring across the cryptonetwork7.",1
"although cryptocurrencies, by their name, are developed and represented as currencies equivalent in purpose to the us$, euro or yen, they are generally treated as assets or stores of wealth, similar to gold8. many individuals or entities simply purchase the coins on exchanges and store them in the hopes of higher future prices. thus, there is high demand and limited supply, creating a strong incentive to participate either actively (that is, mining) or passively (that is, holding). as the nascent industry matures, volatility is expected to decline and their widespread use as a substitute for centralized, fiat currency is more promising1,2. however, this is not currently the case.",1
"as shown in table 1, the blockchain networks of bitcoin, ethereum, monero and litecoin all utilize a proof-of-work time-stamping scheme (that is, tracking changes to the blockchain in time); so-called because the correct answer is proof of work done by the miner9,10. this means two or more miners (that is, thousands) will compete to arrive at the correct answer the fastest, and thereby be rewarded with coins. thus, the cryptonetworks require competition by multiple parties to function7. this competition contributes to the total energy required to produce a new block, which in turn produces new coins (via the reward system)11. the bitcoin network has been estimated to consume as much energy per year as ireland (26 twh yr−1 in 201412 and 22 twh yr−1 in 201811) or hong kong (44 twh yr−1 in 2017)13, but significantly lower estimates also exist (4–5 twh yr−1 in 2017)14. all of these estimates indicate that cryptocurrencies already consume a non-negligible fraction of the world’s energy production.",1
"with bitcoin energy demand now estimated to be equivalent to some countries, new questions arise. do all cryptocurrencies require a similar energy supply to function? in the context of energy invested and value extracted, what conventional processes or services would cryptomining compare to (for example, mining a physical material such as gold15,16,17)? and what environmental impact might this energy consumption cause? here we use the publicly available data and mining hardware characteristics to determine the power requirements for four cryptocurrency networks: bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and monero. we then use market prices to calculate the energy consumed for each asset per us$ created and examine the environmental costs by applying country-specific co2 emission factors to the energy demands of the networks. the four cryptocurrencies analysed here were selected from the top 20 by market capitalization18 on the basis of the availability and completeness of data and the applicability to our methodology. some cryptocurrencies, such as iota, do not employ blockchain technology, and cannot be assessed in the methodology provided here19. alternately, ripple is a centralized blockchain platform and their currency is not mineable, again meaning we could not make an equivalent assessment20.",1
"bitcoin, like a mineral in the earth’s crust, is finite and extractable and, like conventional mining, cryptomining can be energy-intensive11. the energy required to mine cryptocurrencies in a proof-of-work scheme is measurable in the hashrates of the network. hashrates are the number of calculations (hash functions) performed on the network in seconds. as of august 2018, there are approximately 50 quintillion hashes performed on the bitcoin network every second of every day21. the amount of energy required and the rate at which these calculations can be executed are dependent on the type of computer hardware that is used11. as in conventional mining, some equipment may not be profitable or effective and certain tools are useful for one mineral but not another.",1
"blockchain hashrates and coin exchange prices in us$ for bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and monero are shown in fig. 1a–d. the daily hashrates of bitcoin22 (exahashes s−1) are several orders of magnitude larger than those of ethereum23 (terahashes s−1), litecoin (terahashes s−1)21, and monero (megahashes s−1)24. this reflects the higher quantity of calculations being performed and, consequently, a greater amount of energy being consumed by the network. the increasing hashrates are caused by both increasing participation of miners and increasing difficulty of the calculations12. however, comparisons of hashrates across networks might not be meaningful because the mining rigs used to perform these calculations may be different depending on the type of currency being mined. effective mining of bitcoin requires the use of specialized computer hardware known as application-specific integrated circuits (asics)1. monero is asic-resistant and is primarily mined with graphical processing units24. the number of calculations that can be performed by an asic is much higher than can be performed by a graphical processing unit and the asic is more power-efficient per calculation2,25,26. as we show in fig. 1, the market prices of the coins, which decreased for all cryptocurrencies in early 2018, do not necessarily correlate with their respective hashrates. thus, the hashrates for each of the networks (and energy requirements) will probably increase until all of the allotted coins have been mined.",1
"a–d, hashrates of bitcoin (a), ethereum (b), litecoin (c) and monero (d) indicate the intensity of mining activity. they are not necessarily comparable across networks as each coin may utilize different equipment for mining. monero’s asic resistance was hardcoded into the network on 6 april 2018 and is the reason for the sudden decline in hashrates. market prices change in real time. note, the y axes are different for each graph. exa, 1018; tera, 1012; mega, 106. bitcoin hashrates were downloaded from blockchain charts (https://blockchain.info/charts/)22. ethereum hashrates were downloaded from etherscan (https://etherscan.io/chart/hashrate)23. litecoin network hashrates were downloaded from litecoin hashrate (https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/litecoin-hashrate.html)21. monero network hashrates were pulled directly from the monero network (https://getmonero.org/)24 and are reported in the supplementary data. prices were downloaded from coinmarketcap (https://coinmarketcap.com/)18. all network hashrate and price data are supplied in the supplementary data.",1
"previously reported estimates as well as our own estimates of the power requirements of each network are given in table 2. the methodology we used to calculate power and energy is given in the methods and generally follows the process reported by bevand14, in which the power efficiency of the mining rig (joules per hash) is multiplied by the hashrate of the network (hashes per second). unlike the other estimates in table 2, our 2016 and 2017 values are an actual accounting of the entire 366 and 365 days of network energy demand. our 2018 estimates account for all days until 30 june 2018. the value is based only on those 181 days and is not a forecast for the entire 2018 demand. our estimates do not include energy required for cooling systems or other operations and maintenance aspects of running a mining operation, making this the minimum power requirement for each network11.",1
"on the basis of our 2017 estimates, bitcoin alone consumed about as much energy (948 mw = 8.3 billion kwh yr−1) as angola or panama (ranked 102nd and 103rd by total energy consumption)27. the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is approximately us$250 billion, with bitcoin comprising approximately 50% of that value18. if we assume that bitcoin accounted for 50% of the entire crypto-energy consumed in 2017, then the total 16.6 billion kwh yr−1 would be similar to slovenia or cuba (ranked 75th and 76th)27. the last estimate is made with a high level of uncertainty. bitcoin was 73% of the total power demand of the four currencies in 2017 and 68% in 2018 (based on our power requirements in table 2). this is, to our knowledge, the first time any power demand data have been reported for litecoin and monero, and ethereum data are sparse28. it is unknown what the other 16 of the top 20 cryptocurrencies also demand. moreover, there are hundreds of lesser valued currencies that use some amount of energy. our 50% estimate for bitcoin could be too high, in which case our total cryptocurrency energy consumption estimate of 16.6 billion kwh yr−1 would be lower than the actual demand. for a comparison of all our 2016, 2017 and 2018 estimates to national energy demands, refer to supplementary tables 3–5.",1
"bitcoin, in particular, has often been compared to gold or called the ‘new gold’29. gold is, of course, unique among metals because its primary purpose is as a store of wealth and its application in electronics is secondary. however, most metals have a primary functional purpose. their prices are determined by the cost of extraction and market demand. we first compared the energy costs of mining bitcoin with that of mining actual gold, normalizing to us$ generated from the raw material. however, because of gold’s unique place in society and its high market price, we questioned whether the amount of energy to extract a dollar’s worth of gold was itself a unique case. for a more robust comparison, we identified several other minerals of interest: platinum group metals (pgms), rare earth metals, aluminium and copper. each of these has unique applications in society and should give more context to the broader discussion of energy investment into these new digital currencies.",1
"with the daily power requirements of the networks quantified every day from 1 january 2016 to 30 june 2018, we calculated the amount of energy consumed per coin mined, and then normalized that value based on the price (in us$) per coin. we discretized the timescale to a single day (rather than minutes or months) because hashrates, prices and other data are reported by third-party aggregators on a daily basis18,21,22,23. we used the power requirements for each day, and then applied the average time (in minutes) a new block was completed for that day (tb), the number of coins rewarded per block (r) and the us$ price per coin (ex) as detailed in the methods. prices were collected from coinmarketcap (https://coinmarketcap.com/), which reports volume-weighted averages across many international exchanges, reducing the influence of any one market on the prices used in this analysis.",1
"coin rewards (r) and mining rig power efficiencies (pes) are shown in table 3. the pes of the mining rigs11,14,30,31,32 were used in our power estimates presented in the previous section. as the mining rig pes are quite important to our estimates, we have included a brief discussion in the supplementary information regarding our assumptions, with supporting references and data. we also performed a sensitivity analysis with bitcoin miner pes reported by bevand14 and de vries11, the results of which are shown in supplementary fig. 1. daily hashrates, block completion times, market prices, calculated daily power requirements, network velocities and energy costs (ecs) are reported in the supplementary data for each day.",1
"the modelling boundaries to determine energy requirements for metals generally considered fuel and energy inputs and excluded sources from infrastructure, such as the energy to produce roadways or develop the equipment to mine. some of these data come from industry sustainability reports and others come from lifecycle assessments (lcas) or similar analyses. mudd15 estimated that gold production consumed 143 gj kg−1 au from company sustainability reports, whereas norgate and haque16 reported 199–300 gj kg−1 au in a lca of gold production. although lca results in potentially larger, embodied energy estimates, the reported values are similar so the average (215 gj kg−1 au) was used in our calculations (see supplementary table 6). energy consumption for the mining of pgms ranged from 29–241 gj kg−1 pgm with an average33 of 141 gj kg−1 pgm, as shown in supplementary table 7. copper production requires significantly less energy (22 mj kg−1 cu), as identified in sustainability reports34. sverdrup et al.35 performed an analysis of aluminium that examined historic and future mass flows. the values taken from sverdrup et al.35 were the values used as input to their model and are not embodied energy outputs that would include other costs such as storage or other finished goods manufacturing. similarly, in an exergy analysis of aluminium production, balomenos et al.36 identified energy consumption per 1 kg of primary production. balomenos et al.36 reported 99–213 mj kg−1 al and sverdrup et al.35 reported 227–342 mj kg−1 al. we used the average of all values (238 mj kg−1 al), as shown in supplementary table 8. weng et al.37 developed a cradle to gate lifecycle impact assessment of rare earth oxides (reos; that is, rare earth metals). because the scope was limited to the mining and processing and neglected the downstream consumption and use, the energy input (1218 mj kg−1 reos) and the median of reported unit prices (us$140,400 t−1) were used here (see supplementary table 9). we note that their energy consumption value may include energy related to waste management and land use, which were not accounted for in our assessment of cryptocurrencies and we assume those contributions are negligible for this comparison. there is some uncertainty associated with the self-reported values in mine sustainability reports regarding onsite or offsite power generation (that is, direct versus indirect energy consumed)34. as we are interested in the total energy consumed to mine the metals, we can reasonably apply the total energy consumed per kilogram and normalize by price (us$ kg−1) to compare to our cryptocurrency estimates.",1
"commodity prices for 2016 and 2017 were taken from the united states geological survey (usgs) mineral commodity summaries 201838 for gold, pgm, aluminium, reos and copper and from weng et al.37 for reos as detailed in supplementary tables 9 and 10. we recognize that the application of present-day commodities prices to energy demand data from multiple peer-reviewed sources, some several years old, creates some uncertainty to the estimated values. however, we believe that the changes in mining energy demands and metals prices are relatively small compared to the volatility of cryptocurrencies, and therefore, for our purposes the energy consumed per kilogram is static. in both cases (digital and physical), we are comparing ecs of the mining process (that is, cradle to gate).",1
"using the energy required for minerals mining, and the pricing data for 2016 and 2017 from usgs, we estimated annual ecs for aluminium, copper, gold, pgms and reos. price data for 2018 were not available, so an assessment for this year was not made. for cryptomining, daily ecs were averaged for each year and all annual estimates are presented in fig. 2. comparing the 2016 values, we find that bitcoin and monero consumed more energy per us$ generated than copper, gold, pgms and reos, whereas ethereum had a higher ec than only gold and copper and the litecoin ec was not greater than any mineral ec. in 2017, only bitcoin mining had a higher ec than copper, gold, pgms and reos. aluminium mining is much more energy-intensive on a per us$ generated basis than all other assets. one noticeable trend among all cryptocurrencies is the increase in ecs in 2018. this is due to two important and distinct factors: the increasing network activity/energy demands across all years; and the rapid increase (2016–2017) and proceeding decrease (2018) in market value. as the numerator reflects the energy demand and the denominator reflects market prices, as energy increases and price decreases (as observed in 2018), the ec will increase. year-over-year changes in energy per coin mined for all cryptocurrencies are given in supplementary table 12.",1
"aluminium requires substantially more energy per us$ generated than all other assets. the cryptocurrency annual energy costs (mj per us$) are averages of daily values. the mineral ecs are based on peer-reviewed literature and usgs commodity reports. the increase in cryptomining ecs from 2017 to 2018 is linked to the rapid decline in market prices in early 2018. as the ec is normalized to the value of us$, decreases in market price of cryptocurrencies will increase the ec value. sr, sustainability reports.",1
"as an average of all days from 1 january 2016 to 30 june 2018, to generate us$1, we estimate that bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and monero mining required 17, 7, 7 and 14 mj, respectively. in comparison, we estimate that mining aluminium, copper, gold, pgms and reos required 122, 4, 5, 7 and 9 mj to generate us$1. again, the energy requirements we calculated consider only the amount of energy required to mathematically produce new coins. they do not include energy costs for cooling equipment that are typically used in cryptomining applications11 and they also ignore operations and maintenance costs, and infrastructure requirements (for example, access to the internet), meaning that these are lower bound estimates for cryptomining. although hashrate and price data exist for previous years (for example, 2013 and 2014), there is greater uncertainty with respect to reporting of mining rig power efficiencies for previous years2,14. accurate information in this regard would be valuable to make more historical estimates. we note that in our mining rig pe sensitivity analysis, replacing the average values given in table 3 with all 15 values reported by bevand14 and de vries11 (given in supplementary tables 1 and 2), we found for 14 of the 15 scenarios bitcoin mining ecs were still greater than gold ecs. the highest efficiency (that is, lowest pe = 0.06 j gh−1) resulted in an ec = 5 mj per us$, equal to the gold ec. thus, we are confident that the average values used in this analysis and presented in table 3 are appropriate for determining the annual ecs and do not uniquely affect the results. the full range of annual bitcoin mining ecs (5–34 mj per us$) based on the 15 values from bevand14 and de vries11 are presented in supplementary fig. 1.",1
"there may be some concern as to the applicability or appropriateness of comparisons of these seemingly incongruent entities (cryptocurrencies and metals). to be clear, the comparison made is of the energy required for the mining process, not of the cryptocurrency or mineral. our comparison of ethereum mining to platinum mining is not made to suggest that ethereum could be a functional substitute for platinum. rather, the comparison is made to quantify and contextualize the decentralized energy demand that the mining of these cryptocurrencies requires and to encourage debate on whether these energy demands are both sustainable and appropriate given the product that results from relatively similar energy consumption (when normalized by market price). we find that proof-of-work cryptocurrencies consume a considerable amount of power, although bitcoin consumes more than others in overall magnitude, per coin and per us$ value created.",1
"in this analysis, we identify a simple method to evaluate blockchain-based cryptonetwork power requirements and the energy required to produce one us dollar’s worth of coin (here we use us$). this methodology could serve as a foundation to quantify the relative sustainability of individual cryptocurrencies, but current data gaps exist that could alter the conclusions of similar evaluations. the quantification of cryptomining operations and maintenance energy requirements, human labour, electronic waste generation, and other intrinsic costs are not fully known and would be beneficial for future studies. moreover, management and energy requirements for metals, such as transporting and storing gold, may broaden the limited boundaries that we have applied here for a more comprehensive lca and yield different results.",1
"unlike conventional mining, for which the presence of a metal at a given location is prerequisite, cryptocurrency mining can take place anywhere with the availability of electrical power, an internet connection and the appropriate hardware. because the amount of energy required to mine a coin is locality independent, environmental impacts are dependent on the primary energy source utilized. we applied country-specific co2 emission factors from malla39 to the median daily energy requirements of the networks to estimate the geographical effect of the energy mix on the carbon footprint for each of the cryptocurrencies (emission factors reported in supplementary table 13). there is some inherent uncertainty to these values as malla39 was published nine years ago and the data may not reflect current conditions. however, we feel that the application of these data is acceptable as the main point is to present a methodology that identifies differences in co2 emissions based on national energy mixes and the average amount of energy consumed to generate a coin. in this case, energy required per coin mined is the median value of all calculated values from 1 january 2016 to 30 june 2018. as shown in supplementary fig. 2, the energy consumed per coin mined (mwh per coin) has increased substantially in the previous two and a half years for all cryptocurrencies. thus, we felt the median value was more appropriate than the average for this data point (see methods).",1
"using primary energy mixes of india, australia, china, the united states, japan, korea and canada, we see how their carbon footprint is impacted in fig. 3. on the basis of the emission factors from malla39, any cryptocurrency mined in china would generate four times the amount of co2 compared to the amount generated in canada. applying the highest and lowest carbon emission factors (india and canada) as upper and lower bounds and based on the number of coins generated between 1 january 2016 and 30 june 2018 (2,094,699 coins; see supplementary table 15), 3–13 million metric tonnes co2 can be attributed to the bitcoin network. using the same approach, we estimate ethereum, litecoin and monero mining generated 300,000–1.6 million tonnes co2 combined (see supplementary tables 16–18). thus, for the study period, cryptomining of these 4 is responsible for at least 3–15 million tonnes co2 emitted, with bitcoin being the largest contributor. in the short term, this may be problematic, because a large portion of cryptocurrency mining occurs in china40,41. however, some industrial-scale operations are moving from china to canada to take advantage of cheaper and cleaner energy2,40,41.",1
"country-specific co2 emission factors for energy were reported in malla39 and applied to the average energy demand per coin (kwh per coin) from 1 january 2016 to 30 june 2018. note that the values are on a log scale, demonstrating that bitcoin (btc) produces significantly more co2 emissions than ethereum (eth), litecoin (ltc) or monero (xmr). the calculated values are reported in supplementary table 12. on 30 june 2018 (reported in the supplementary information), we see one bitcoin was worth approximately 49 times 1 monero, but potentially emitted 132 times more co2 per coin.",1
"future growth and adoption of these digital currencies is unknown. the worldwide mining of cryptocurrencies is currently performed for self-gain11 but this alone does not preclude it from potentially benefiting society. from a long-term perspective, the mining of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, is a temporary phase in the proposed lifecycle of the network. currently, 81% of bitcoins set to exist have been mined42. however, given the current rate of mining, the last coins will not be mined until approximately 214043. given the length of time until that point and on the basis of the data presented here, we can assume that the network energy requirements of bitcoin and litecoin will continue to increase for the foreseeable future. however, monero’s hard fork (that is, change in code) on 6 april 2018, observable in fig. 1, indicates a considerable drop in network energy demand. moreover, ethereum’s future move to proof-of-stake could reduce long-term network energy requirements. therefore, future environmental impacts for any of the cryptocurrencies on a per-coin-mined basis may be greater or less than those determined in our current assessment.",1
"to quantify the power requirement per cryptonetwork, the daily hashrate was multiplied by the energy consumption of a typical mining computer, as performed by bevand14. a brief review and discussion of the previous estimates reported in table 2 is given in the supplementary information. values used in these calculations are given in fig. 1, table 3, and the supplementary information. for all cryptocurrencies, the daily network hashrate multiplied by the hashing or power efficiency (pe) of the mining rig (that is, computer) established the amount of power consumed by the entire network, as shown in equation (1). the hashrate is the number of computations being performed across the entire network per second. the hardware used to mine coins dictates the number of calculations performed per second and the power efficiency at which it can perform those calculations.",1

"this process was performed for bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and monero. although market capitalization will change with coin value (which changes in real time), these four were picked on the basis of availability of data and to identify whether different energy requirements existed among the more established coins. the value of each coin in us$ was taken as the value at the close of each day (that is, 23:59), given in the supplementary data. the final ec values are averages of the study period (911 days) or annual averages for 2016, 2017 and 2018. daily ec values are reported in the supplementary information. average, standard deviation and median values for all 911 days are reported in supplementary table 12. although the annual standard deviations were large for some cryptocurrencies compared to the average value, because they were less than the average and because the median values were similar to the arithmetic average, the average values are presented in fig. 2 and reported in the text.",1
"literature values were sourced for the energy consumption to produce 1 kg or 1 t of gold15,16, pgms33, reos37, and aluminium35,36. market prices for the metals were obtained from the united states usgs38. these values were multiplied to determine the energy requirement of metal generated per us$, as shown in equation (4). the literature-reviewed values as well as market prices are reported in the main text. this made the values of energy invested for digital and physical assets comparable, as shown in equation (4).",1
"a final assessment of the potential environmental footprint of each of the networks was made by applying peer-reviewed data of country-specific emissions factors (kg co2 per kwh−1) for energy supply by the daily calculated energy required to produce a single coin, as shown in equation (5). the emission factors and calculated carbon costs are reported in supplementary table 14.",1
"for the study period of 911 days, the median daily nc value for each cryptonetwork was then determined (see supplementary table 12). the median is used here because the standard deviation of the data set was greater than the arithmetic average, indicating a non-normal distribution of values (given in the supplementary information). whereas ecs change with respect to energy and price, nc values change only with respect to network energy requirements. then the country-specific emission factors (y) were applied to estimate the emissions of co2 per coin as shown in equation (6). this created several potential values for each cryptocurrency, as shown in fig. 3.",1
"where tc is the carbon cost defined as the mass of carbon dioxide emitted per coin mined, y is the mass of co2 emitted per kilowatt hour of energy generated for a country or region and median(nc) refers to the median nc value.",1
"as the location of each miner cannot be determined, the attribution of emissions can be only broadly estimated. in this case, we estimate using the highest and lowest country-specific emission factors (india and canada, respectively) as the upper and lower bounds, as presented in supplementary tables 15–18. to identify the total co2 emissions attributable to each cryptocurrency network from mining, we determined the daily number of coins created from the daily average block completion time and block reward as shown in equation (7).",1

there are now hundreds of cryptocurrencies in existence and the technological backbone of many of these currencies is blockchain—a digital ledger of transactions. the competitive process of adding blocks to the chain is computation-intensive and requires large energy input. here we demonstrate a methodology for calculating the minimum power requirements of several cryptocurrency networks and the energy consumed to produce one us dollar’s (us$) worth of digital assets. from 1 january 2016 to 30…,1
"the theoretical framework of the study covers the formation and development of cryptoeconomics, as well as its impact on the environment. the term cryptoeconomics is used to refer to a new industry,",1
"this paper only focuses on computational power demand during the proof-of-work process rather than estimating the whole energy intensity of mining, and makes use of 160 gb of bitcoin blockchain data to estimate the energy consumption and power demand of bitcoin mining.",1
"summary participation in the bitcoin blockchain validation process requires specialized hardware and vast amounts of electricity, which translates into a significant carbon footprint. here, we",1
"bitcoin is a virtual, decentralized currency based on blockchain technology. regardless of where you send bitcoin, the greenhouse gas emissions stemming from these transactions are distributed",1
"the annual electricity consumption of cryptocurrency transactions has grown substantially in recent years, partially driven by the increasing difficulty in mining, but also driven by the large number",1
"this research examined cryptocurrencies true profitability through cost-benefit analysis and evaluated its environmental footprint, utilizing a range of scenarios and various models to define the circumstances under which cryptocurrency evolution could be beneficiary or the opposite, the scenarios when it becomes a dramatic burden on society.",1
"the higher the crypto-currency activities are, the higher the energy consumption is, affecting therefore the environment, and the findings show a negative influence of the trading of crypto-currencies.",1
"it is concluded that specialist hardware is usually required to make bitcoin mining profitable, and it is shown that the power currently used for bitcoin mining is comparable to ireland's electricity consumption.",1
"despite a crackdown on bitcoin in china last year, mining the largest cryptocurrency actually got much dirtier and emits around the same amount of co2 annually as a country the size of greece, a new study shows.",1
"the joint study, titled revisiting bitcoin's carbon footprint, showed that the share of renewable electricity sources that fuel the bitcoin network may have decreased from an average of 41.6 per cent in 2020 to 25.1 per cent in august 2021.",1
"in may 2021, chinese authorities ordered a crackdown on crypto mining and trading and regulators banned financial institutions from offering services related to cryptocurrencies.",1
"one of the reasons for the decline in renewable energy sources powering bitcoin mining is because the bitcoin network no longer had access to hydropower from the chinese provinces of sichuan and yunnan, said alex de vries, one of the authors of the study and a researcher at the school of business and economics at the vrije universiteit in amsterdam.",1
"""the reason why they had that amount of renewables was because within china, they could move around and they could get hydropower during the summer months and then in the winter months, they would be using coal,"" he told euronews next.",0
"""kazakhstan coal replaced the chinese coal, and kazakhstan uses hardcore, which is the worst type of coal, the most carbon-intensive type of coal,” de vries said, adding that in the us, miners replaced hydropower with natural gas.",1
"but the system, which works like a competitive numeric guessing game, requires a global network of computers to run at the same time when a transaction takes place. this is why it uses so much energy as it is designed to encourage increased computing effort.",0
"bitcoin was built to resist regulation and censorship but, according to de vries, even if every country banned proof of work mining, it would not make much difference.",1
"""as a country, you can't really hide mining on the grid but as soon as that type of operation is completely forbidden then the next issue is that people can still buy these machines and put them in their own houses,"" he said.",0
"""you would have to bring down the price of renewables by law to make sure that these mines only use renewables, and then the question is, do you want them using your renewables because you'd have to subsidise it for them? but what are you getting back for?"" de vries said.",0

"country usage numbers are from 2019. electricity cost for miners is assumed to average $0.05 per kilowatt-hour. upper, lower and best guess trends are estimated using the research methodology behind the cambridge bitcoin electricity consumption index.",1
"actual electricity use would have been higher because of less efficient machines and the need for cooling systems. electrical usage is compared to the average annual electricity consumption for a u.s. residential utility customer in 2019 of 10,649 kilowatt-hours.",1
"cryptocurrencies have emerged as one of the most captivating, yet head-scratching, investments in the world. they soar in value. they crash. they’ll change the world, their fans claim, by displacing traditional currencies like the dollar, rupee or ruble. they’re named after dog memes.",1
"we’ll explain how that works in a minute. but first, consider this: the process of creating bitcoin to spend or trade consumes around 91 terawatt-hours of electricity annually, more than is used by finland, a nation of about 5.5 million.",1
"currencies like these seem like such a simple, brilliant idea. a government prints some paper and guarantees its value. then we swap it amongst ourselves for cars, candy bars and tube socks. we can give it to whomever we want, or even destroy it.",0
"traditional kinds of money, such as those created by the united states or other governments, aren’t entirely free to be used any way you wish. banks, credit-card networks and other middlemen can exercise control over who can use their financial networks and what they can be used for — often for good reason, to prevent money laundering and other nefarious activities. but that could also mean that if you transfer a big amount of money to someone, your bank will report it to the government even if the transfer is completely on the up-and-up.",1
"in 2008, an unknown person or persons using the name satoshi nakamoto published a proposal to create a cash-like electronic payment system that would do exactly that: cut out the middlemen. that’s the origin of bitcoin.",1
"bitcoin users wouldn’t have to trust a third party — a bank, a government or whatever — nakamoto said, because transactions would be managed by a decentralized network of bitcoin users. in other words, no single person or entity could control it. all bitcoin transactions would be openly accounted for in a public ledger that anyone could examine, and new bitcoins would be created as a reward to participants for helping to manage this vast, sprawling, computerized ledger. but the ultimate supply of bitcoins would be limited. the idea was that growing demand over time would give bitcoins their value.",1
"but today, a single bitcoin is worth about $50,000, though that could vary wildly by the time you read this, and no one can stop you from sending it to whomever you like. (of course, if someone is caught buying illegal drugs or orchestrating ransomware attacks, two of the many unsavory uses for which cryptocurrency has proved attractive, they’d still be subject to the law of the land.)",1
"let’s say you want to buy something and pay with bitcoin. the first part is quick and easy: you’d open an account with a bitcoin exchange like coinbase, which lets you purchase bitcoin with dollars.",1
"you now have a “digital wallet” with some bitcoin in it. to spend it, you simply send bitcoin into the digital wallet of the person you’re buying something from. easy as that.",1
"but that transaction, or really any exchange of bitcoin, must first be validated by the bitcoin network. in the simplest terms, this is the process by which the seller can be assured that the bitcoins he or she is receiving are real.",1
this gets to the very heart of the whole bitcoin bookkeeping system: the maintenance of the vast bitcoin public ledger. and this is where much of the electrical energy gets consumed.,1
"all around the world, companies and individuals known as bitcoin miners are competing to be the ones to validate transactions and enter them into the public ledger of all bitcoin transactions. they basically play a guessing game, using powerful, and power-hungry, computers to try to beat out others. because if they are successful, they’re rewarded with newly created bitcoin, which of course is worth a lot of money.",1
"you can think of it  like a lottery, or a game of dice. this article provides a good analogy: imagine you’re at a casino and everyone playing has a die with 500 sides. (more accurately, it would have billions of billions of sides, but that’s hard to draw.) the winner is the first person to roll a number under 10.",0
"the more computer power you have, the more guesses you can make quickly. so, unlike at the casino, where you have just one die to roll at human speed, you can have many computers making many, many guesses every second.",0
"the bitcoin network is designed to make the guessing game more and more difficult as more miners participate, further putting a premium on speedy, power-hungry computers. specifically, it’s designed so that it always takes an average of 10 minutes for someone to win a round. in the dice game analogy, if more people join the game and start winning faster, the game is recalibrated to make it harder. for example: you now have to roll a number under 4, or you have to roll exactly a 1.",1
"that’s why bitcoin miners now have warehouses packed with powerful computers, racing at top speed to guess big numbers and using tremendous quantities of energy in the process.",1
"the winner of the guessing game validates a standard “block” of bitcoin transactions, and is rewarded for doing so with 6.25 newly minted bitcoins, each worth about $50,000. so you can see why people might flock into mining.",1
why such a complicated and expensive guessing game? that’s because simply recording the transactions in the ledger would be trivially easy. so the challenge is to ensure that only “trustworthy” computers do so.,0
"a bad actor could wreak havoc on the system, stopping legitimate transfers or scamming people with fake bitcoin transactions. but the way bitcoin is designed means that a bad actor would need to win the majority of the guessing games to have majority power over the network, which would require a lot of money and a lot of electricity.",1
"in nakamoto’s system, it would make more economic sense for a hacker to spend the resources on mining bitcoin and collecting the rewards, rather than on attacking the system itself.",1
"here’s a timeline showing how things have changed. you can see how much electricity would have been used to mine one bitcoin at home (in terms of the average home electricity bill), assuming the most energy-efficient devices available were used.",1
"today you need highly specialized machines, a lot of money, a big space and enough cooling power to keep the constantly running hardware from overheating. that’s why mining now happens in giant data centers owned by companies or groups of people.",1
"in fact, operations have consolidated so much that now, only seven mining groups own nearly 80 percent of all computing power on the network. (the aim behind “pooling” computing power like this is to distribute income more evenly so participants get $10 per day rather than $50,000 every 10 years, for example.)",1
"mining happens all over the world, often wherever there’s an abundance of cheap energy. for years, much of the bitcoin mining has been in china, although recently, the country has started cracking down. researchers at the university of cambridge who have been tracking bitcoin mining said recently that china’s share of global bitcoin mining had fallen to 46 percent in april from 75 percent in late 2019. meanwhile, the united states’ share of mining grew to 16 percent from 4 percent during the same period.",1
"bitcoin mining means more than just emissions. hardware piles up, too. everyone wants the newest, fastest machinery, which causes high turnover and a new e-waste problem. alex de vries, a paris-based economist, estimates that every year and a half or so, the computational power of mining hardware doubles, making older machines obsolete. according to his calculations, at the start of 2021, bitcoin alone was generating more e-waste than many midsize countries.",1
"“bitcoin miners are completely ignoring this issue, because they don’t have a solution,” said mr. de vries, who runs digiconomist, a site that tracks the sustainability of cryptocurrencies. “these machines are just dumped.”",1
it’s tricky to figure out exactly how much of bitcoin mining is powered by renewables because of the very nature of bitcoin: a decentralized currency whose miners are largely anonymous.,1
"globally, estimates of bitcoin’s use of renewables range from about 40 percent to almost 75 percent. but in general, experts say, using renewable energy to power bitcoin mining means it won’t be available to power a home, a factory or an electric car.",1
"a handful of miners are starting to experiment with harnessing excess natural gas from oil and gas drilling sites, but examples like that are still sparse and difficult to quantify. plus, that practice could eventually spur more drilling. miners have also claimed to tap the surplus hydropower generated during the rainy season in places like southwest china. but if those miners operate through the dry season, they would primarily be drawing on fossil fuels.",0
"“as far as we can tell, it’s mostly baseload fossil fuels that are still being used, but that varies seasonally, as well as country to country,” said benjamin a. jones, an assistant professor in economics at the university of new mexico, whose research involves the environmental impact of cryptomining. “that’s why you get these wildly different estimates,” he said.",1
"could the way bitcoin works be rewritten to use less energy? some other minor cryptocurrencies have promoted an alternate bookkeeping system, where processing transactions is won not through computational labor but by proving ownership of enough coins. this would be more efficient. but it hasn’t been proven at scale, and isn’t likely to take hold with bitcoin because, among other reasons, bitcoin stakeholders have a powerful financial incentive not to change, since they’ve already invested so much in mining.",1
"some governments are as wary of bitcoin as environmentalists are. if they were to limit mining, that could theoretically reduce the energy strain. but remember, this is a network designed to exist without middlemen. places like china are already creating restrictions around mining, but miners are reportedly moving to coal-rich kazakhstan and the cheap-but-troubled texas electric grid.",1
"though bitcoin mining might not involve pickaxes and hard hats, it’s not a purely digital abstraction, either: it is connected to  the physical world of fossil fuels, power grids and emissions, and to the climate crisis we’re in today. what was imagined as a forward-thinking digital currency has already had real-world ramifications, and those continue to mount.",1

"this paper proposes a flexible consensus mechanism called proof of engagement (poe), based on the activity and contribution of network nodes, and analyzes the incentive compatibility of poe from the perspective of mechanism design.",0
"surprisingly, the results suggest that, on average, cryptocurrencies employing proof-of-work consensus protocols do not generate returns that are significantly different from those that incorporate proof- of-stake consensus protocols, and cryptocurrencies that incorporate the hybrid version of these consensus protocols generate significantly higher average returns.",1
"cryptocurrencies have seen a meteoric rise in their adoption and value over the past decade. for instance, the most widely-traded cryptocurrency, bitcoin, which started at only a few cents per token",1

"it is found that emission factors of purchased electricity in many provinces are quite different from the emission factors of electricity generation, indicating the importance of the network approach in accurately reflecting embodied emissions.",1
"the cryptocurrency industry is growing quickly, as are concerns about its environmental impact. the original and most popular crypto, bitcoin, is energy-intensive by design, “mined” by millions of high-powered computers around the world.",1
"that puts enthusiasts in a tough position. they say crypto tokens will power a decentralized internet, changing the economics of banking, finance, gaming, shopping, entertainment and even human interaction.",1
"but if crypto, already worth $2 trillion, is the future, this industry — like any other — can’t afford to ignore climate change and must embrace sustainability. ether, the second-most popular cryptocurrency, uses a lot of power, like bitcoin, but its developers are planning a transition to a mining method that is more friendly to the environment.",1
"dealbook gathered three prominent experts to debate the solutions for greening crypto: alex de vries, a data scientist who created the bitcoin energy consumption index; kathleen breitman, co-founder of the tezos blockchain network; and paul prager, chief executive and founder of the bitcoin mining company terawulf, who is an energy industry veteran.",1
"much of crypto’s environmental impact comes from the energy used by computers to generate new digital tokens, via a process called “proof of work.” this requires a lot of processing power: by some measures, the server farms that compete to generate new bitcoins use as much electricity annually as a small country, like chile or belgium.",1
"de vries: mining is creating new blocks for the bitcoin blockchain. those transactions will return rewards, paid in bitcoin. the energy consumption is in the part where you are trying to complete these blocks for the blockchain. you have about three million machines around the world participating in a massive game of ‘guess the number,’ generating 140 quintillion guesses every second of the day, nonstop. then, they get to create the next part for the blockchain, but that’s the energy consuming part. and not every cryptocurrency needs that.",1
"breitman: i started a competing project, but i think it’s telling for the purposes of our discussion that basically no cryptocurrency that has launched in the last four or five years has used proof of work, and that’s because it’s antiquated technology. i would argue that the associated energy costs, some are justified because of the goal of what they do. but i would qualify that. using a technology that creates an unnecessary amount of tax on the environment — which, as someone who believes in man-made climate change, i’m very inclined to not endorse.",1
"green energy goes to waste if it’s not used when generated. batteries that can store renewable power for when the sun isn’t shining or wind isn’t blowing are the holy grail of the energy industry. for now, these don’t exist at the necessary scale. but some see a way that bitcoin could function as another sort of “battery.” it could store the value of renewable energy by converting intermittently available local solar and wind power into a globally traded digital asset with unlimited shelf life.",1
"another way bitcoin mining can be made more sustainable, some argue, is to use “stranded” or wasted energy, for example capturing the power of flare gas at oil patches to mint digital money.",1
"prager: when you have an electrical grid, you want that grid to become increasingly more sustainable. have a lot more renewables. these are intermittent energy supply choices — hydro, solar and wind, which are all great, which we will be sourcing for our mining capacity. you want to have a load that is constant, which enables the grid to be robust. you have this load that is bitcoin mining all the time, but that load could go away. it could be shut off in the 200 hours a year when there are supply strains. so it’s good for the grid. that’s good for everyone.",1
breitman: a one-way battery isn’t a battery. there’s bitcoin mining in texas. there was a crisis there and people were freezing. why weren’t they able to use the energy stored in that bitcoin battery? that’s not a battery.,0
"prager: at the end of the day, there is a massive amount of electricity in our country that is simply stranded or wasted. so again, context. you need spinning reserves here. you need flexible baseload facilities to be able to develop the grid if everyone wants sustainability, and i certainly do. that is what zero carbon emission bitcoin mining does.",1
"de vries: bitcoin uses a lot of energy, but if it’s a use of energy that would otherwise be going to waste then it’s not really a problem. and that’s a lot of the so-called stranded assets. but in a lot of cases those assets happen to be fossil fuel. china recently banned bitcoin mining because these bitcoin miners were ultimately responsible for the revival of coal mines. we are seeing similar examples in the u.s. and new york, where a gas plant was revived from mining bitcoin.",1
"an often-overlooked factor in the environmental cost of crypto is the mining hardware, which becomes outdated quickly and generates toxic electronic waste.",1
"de vries: bitcoin miners are trying to make more profitable equipment all the time, and those machines are improving at a rapid rate. they are older generations pretty quickly and they are so specialized. that’s not just about carbon emissions, but also pushing up i.t. equipment waste. it’s also toxic materials. that’s water pollution, and parts in the incinerator at some point, and that no amount of renewables can ever fix.",1
"de vries: mining requires highly specialized equipment. as soon as the bitcoin price runs up, what happens is the money that goes to bitcoin mining goes up. they have a big incentive to add more machines. as soon as that goes up, they, first of all, impact that global semiconductor supply chain. you could instead have made a chip for maybe a personal computer or electric vehicle or anything else. it is hard to quantify what the consequences are of that.",1
"two forms of regulation are likely when it comes to crypto’s environmental cost, mr. prager said. the first type would require more transparency about the carbon costs of running a crypto business, and the second would impose some sort of carbon tax. “we think at the end of the day that people who choose to run businesses that use fossil fuels will have higher costs than people who have businesses that don’t use fossil fuels,” he said.",1
"environmental and economic justice organizations are pressing for these types of requirements. this week, more than 70 nonprofits, including sierra club, the open markets institute and the action center on race and the economy, urged congress to factor crypto’s energy use into any new rules for the sector. “as you explore legislative and regulatory responses to ensure investor protection in the industry, it is critical that you also consider the financial stability risks that climate change presents,” they wrote in a letter to congressional leaders.",1
"but the wheels of government turn slowly and crypto is developing very quickly, so it will likely be up to the industry to embrace sustainability with the same intensity as it has innovation.",1

"""bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind,” gates told the new york times in a recent interview, calling himself a ""bitcoin skeptic,"" and adding that ""it’s not a great climate thing.”",1
"to gates' point, alex de vries, a data scientist at the dutch central bank, estimates that each bitcoin transaction requires an average 300 kg of carbon dioxide (co2)–equivalent to the carbon footprint produced by roughly 750,000 visa swipes.",1
"that's because nearly all cryptocurrencies, bitcoin included, document every single transaction on what's called a public ledger, which helps ensure transactions are transparent and safe from tampering, but continuously requires additional storage space, or ""blocks.""",1
"blocks are created by miners, who are awarded bitcoin for their work, running code around the clock on special hardware called rigs–a process that consumes the same amount of energy annually (around 78.5 terawatt-hours) as nations like chile, austria and finland.",1
"compounding the problem, mining networks are largely based in china, which sources much of its power from fossil fuels like coal, and as the cryptocurrency becomes more popular, its energy consumption has soared by a factor of 10 since just 2017.",1

"a single bitcoin transaction uses roughly 707.6 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy–equivalent to the power consumed by an average u.s. household over 24 days, according to digiconomist. on a yearly basis, bitcoin consumes more energy than all but 38 countries, falling in line with countries like finland, chile and austria.",1

"bitcoin uses the proof-of-work (pow) protocol. pow involves a network of miners competing to solve cryptographic puzzles and verify transactions using hefty computational power. the first miner to solve the puzzle earns btc as a reward. as you can imagine, thousands of miners bumping heads to outpower one another is bound to be an eco-unfriendly system.",1

"ripple is the greenest cryptocurrency of all the altcoins analyzed by trg datacenters. it only consumes 0.0079 kilowatts per hour (kwh) while bitcoin's power consumption equals the energy waste of argentina. as mentioned, ripple doesn't use pow like bitcoin. it uses a protocol that polls its network to validate account balances and transactions. if the majority agrees on the transaction's integrity, it gets the green light.",1
"ripple facilitates cross-border financial payments. in other words, ripple mitigates the frustration that comes with sending money to foreign nations. currently, cross-border financial payments are slow, expensive and require several middlemen who all want a piece of the pie. ripple, on the other hand, is super fast; it processes over 1,500 transactions per second. this is nearly seven times faster than international e-wallets like paypal.",1

"to achieve a sustainable energy system, a further increase in electricity generation from renewable energy sources (res) is imperative. however, the development and implementation of res entail various challenges, e.g., dealing with grid stability issues due to res’ intermittency. correspondingly, increasingly volatile and even negative electricity prices question the economic viability of res-plants. to address these challenges, this paper analyzes how the integration of an res-plant and a computationally intensive, energy-consuming data center (dc) can promote investments in res-plants. an optimization model is developed that calculates the net present value (npv) of an integrated energy system (ies) comprising an res-plant and a dc, where the dc may directly consume electricity from the res-plant. to gain applicable knowledge, this paper evaluates the developed model by means of two use-cases with real-world data, namely aws computing instances for training machine learning algorithms and bitcoin mining as relevant dc applications. the results illustrate that for both cases the npv of the ies compared to a stand-alone res-plant increases, which may lead to a promotion of res-plants. the evaluation also finds that the ies may be able to provide significant energy flexibility that can be used to stabilize the electricity grid. finally, the ies may also help to reduce the carbon-footprint of new energy-intensive dc applications by directly consuming electricity from res-plants.",0
"in line with the paris agreement and the united nations sustainability goals, i.e., the development and implementation of a sustainable energy system including a phase-out of fossil power plants, the share of renewable energy sources (res) in the global energy mix has already risen significantly in the past years and continues to grow steadily (united nations 2015). despite decreasing carbon dioxide emissions, the increasing share of res also poses several challenges: on the grid level, the inherent intermittency of res leads to challenges for grid stability and requires cost-intensive congestion management (rausch et al. 2019). in germany alone, these circumstances yielded costs of € 1.5 bn in 2018 for redispatch interventions (bundesnetzagentur 2019). ultimately, as both electricity grids and electricity demand have not yet been adjusted to the new generation structure of high shares of res, the intermittent electricity supply of res can ultimately not be optimally used within the system (linnemann et al. 2011; nieße et al. 2012). this demonstrates an increased need for flexibility, referring to the ability to balance electricity demand and supply at short notice to ensure grid stability and the successful integration of res (heffron et al. 2021; palensky and dietrich 2011).",1
"moreover, on the level of individual plant operation, a major challenge of res consists in the highly volatile and even negative electricity prices (fanone et al. 2013): increasing the uncertainty of (future) income of res-plant operators, such price characteristics directly challenge a viable operation of existing res-plants and pose a possible barrier to further investments in new res-plants.",0
"hence, research and practice intensively consider different possibilities to tackle challenges related to res’ intermittency: among others, corresponding flexibility technologies comprise batteries, sector-coupling, grid expansion, and demand response (heffron et al. 2020; lannoye et al. 2015). furthermore, research in the field of energy economics already discusses the approach of a local integration, i.e., the possibility to supply local flexibility by converting excess electricity on-site into goods, e.g., hydrogen, that may be stored or then sold on other non-electricity markets (glenk and reichelstein 2019; hosseini and wahid 2016).",0
"with respect to the development of a sustainable energy system with sufficient flexibility, research reflects the crucial role of information systems (is), constituting the fields of energy informatics (ei) and green is (buhl and jetter 2009; goebel et al. 2014; watson et al. 2010). in this context, there exists a wide-ranging research stream dealing with the energy consumption of data centers (dc) and with the question how dcs can be designed more efficiently (beloglazov et al. 2011; pedram 2012). this includes (technical) literature concerning an efficient dc operation and a corresponding design. moreover, this research stream also includes conceptual literature that elaborates on benefits of using dcs for the whole electricity system, e.g., by supplying flexibility through a participation in demand response (dr) programs. another example relates to a spatial distribution of dcs and corresponding flexibility (klingert 2018; shi et al. 2016). in this context, fridgen et al. (2017) discuss the idea of utilizing spatially distributed dcs to effectively supply flexibility by spatial load migration of computational power. moreover, related literature already introduces the local combination of dcs and res-plants (ahmad et al. 2019; goiri et al. 2013). however, this literature puts dcs at the core of research and mainly aims for lowering the electricity bill and the carbon-footprint of a dc. thus, it lacks the ability to address the challenges of the development of a sustainable energy system with respect to a viable future operation of res.",0
"as highlighted above, to address the challenges of future energy systems, research needs to focus on an appropriate implementation and operation of res-plants. hence, – and in contrast to existing literature on dcs – our work puts the res-plant at the core of our research and reflects on energy-intensive dcs as a means to contribute to a viable operation of and investment in res-plants. we note that there are first companies, e.g., windcores, which integrate res-plants and dcs in reality. however, the res-plant and the dc are predominantly not operated by the same company (moss 2018), while the theory behind these first real-world examples is still missing. so far and to the best of our knowledge, research does not consider the approach of a local integration of res-plants and electricity conversion into computing power (with respect to an is-application) with the aim of increasing the economic viability of an res-plant operation. hence, we pose the following research question in the light of ei:",0
"how can the integration of an intermittent res-plant and a computationally intensive, energy-consuming dc yield an increased net present value compared to a stand-alone res-plant?",0
"in line with gholami et al. (2016), our paper constitutes application-oriented is research that addresses the two challenges, namely the need for additional flexibility in the future electricity system and an economically viable operation of res-plants. hereby, we refer to the concept of integrated energy systems (ies), in general consisting of at least two plants, one of which is an energy consumer and the other an energy supplier (bai et al. 2016). following bai et al. (2016), who provide an optimization model for an operation of gas-electricity ies, in this paper we analyze the impact of an ies – consisting of an res-plant and a temporally flexible dc application – on the economic viability of an res-plant using two exemplary use-cases. within our ies, the res-plant generates electricity that may either be sold on a corresponding electricity market or consumed locally within the ies by the dc. we reflect that an increasing net present value (npv) of the res-plant within an ies may lead to increasing investments in res-plants, and can, therefore, be considered as a means to promote new res-plants.",1
"we note that the npv of the ies can be increased by a variety of use-cases for the integrated plant, ranging, e.g., from (training) machine learning (ml) algorithms by cloud-computing dcs to (computerized) batch production of physical goods. however, we are also aware of the fact that the production of physical goods may be associated with a higher complexity when compared to a dc use-case. to illustrate the applicability of our approach, we therefore evaluate it with real-world data for two use-cases: while also providing the basis for future research in the context of iess, in this paper we exemplarily reflect an integrated dc (1) as instances for training ml algorithms (here: amazon web services (aws)), and (2) for mining cryptocurrencies (here: bitcoin). hence, the objective of this paper is the development and quantitative evaluation of an economic model that considers an optimal investment decision into an ies using the npv. to the best of our knowledge, an ies has neither been modeled nor quantitively evaluated as (1) opportunity to increase investments in res-plants in times of volatile electricity prices and (2) as a supplier of energy flexibility in the light of ei. moreover, we note that our model may also be of high relevance for res-plant operators whose res subsidy programs expire in the near future – as is, for example, the case in germany where subsidies for 45gw of wind capacity have expired in 2020 (friedemann 2018).",1
"our work contributes in various ways to research and practice: we build on (1) research on optimizing costs of dcs, on (2) research on green it, i.e., the environmentally friendly and resource-saving use of it throughout its entire life cycle, and on (3) research on green is, i.e., using it to increase sustainability in various fields. we are the first to introduce the approach of integrating res-plants and dcs to increase the economic viability of res-plants, and our evaluation illustrates that this approach is applicable in practice. additionally, we contribute to is research on energy flexibility, see e.g., kahlen et al. (2014), fridgen et al. (2016), and keller et al. (2020). moreover and following watson et al. (2010), our ies provides the opportunity to use flow networks more efficiently as it is able to shift energy demand and, in this way, to supply local flexibility.",0
"the structure of our paper is as follows: we provide relevant background for our research in sect. 2. in line with the research cycle proposed by meredith et al. (1989), sect. 3.1 introduces our methodology while we develop and describe our economic model in sect. 3.2. concerning our evaluation, we discuss the applicability and relevance of our use-cases in sect. 4. then, sect. 5 describes the data used for the evaluation and discusses corresponding results. section 6 highlights the contribution of our paper, and sect. 7 finally concludes, providing limitations and an outlook for further research.",0
"in addition to the literature mentioned in the introduction, we identify the following four research streams in academic literature that provide background for our analysis of integrating an intermittent res-plant and a dc: ei, dcs, iess, and energy flexibility.",0
"regarding ei, watson et al. (2010) propose the field of ei that aims to implement a sustainable energy system by “analyzing, designing, and implementing systems to increase the efficiency of energy demand and supply systems” (watson et al. 2010, p. 24). in this light, our paper analyzes both, the res-plant and the integrated dc, as a part of a flow network where both parts constitute sensitized objects that are adaptable with respect to their electricity demand and supply (watson et al. 2010). the recent streams of ei combine – as also highlighted in the call for this special issue – “the perspectives of electrical engineering, energy economics, and information technology” (staudt et al. 2019). this is in line with zhang et al. (2018), who state that ei analyzes various digital technologies and “their applications in the energy sectors” to tackle energy-related challenges, see, e.g., förderer et al. (2018) or holly et al. (2020). literature in this field finds that the intelligent management of dcs can introduce positive effects on the stability of such flow network and offer appropriate economic incentives (thimmel et al. 2019). this is also closely related to the prevalent idea in is research of it-enabled transdisciplinary sustainable business transformations, according to elliot (2011), who proposes the idea that ei can help to lower humans’ ecological impact through research on these complex phenomena. zhang et al. (2011a) state that there are diverse opportunities to contribute to ei goals and thus motivate the need for and development of a strategic framework to effectively implement those. this is in line with ei researchers, who highlight both, the responsibility of is research and corresponding opportunities in the near future (buhl and jetter 2009; goebel et al. 2014). therefore, our work contributes to ei research by reflecting a dc as an enabler for a more viable operation of res-plants, which may, in turn, foster a sustainable transformation.",0
"regarding dcs, we already mentioned the wide-ranging research stream on energy consumption of dcs in our introduction. while research on the operation of dcs has focused on increasing their performance for decades, reducing energy costs gained more attention in the last years due to rising electricity prices (beloglazov et al. 2011). as dcs are expected to account for about 20% of total electricity demand in 2030 (jones 2018), research analyzes the question of how to make dcs more energy-efficient in various ways (pedram 2012). such ways include, e.g., technical aspects of dcs redundancy architecture and workload prediction, approaches to use heat generated by the dc, or the participation of dcs in dr-programs (kliazovich et al. 2013; klingert 2018; shi et al. 2016; shuja et al. 2012). the ability to take part in dr-programs is, of course, dependent on the level of flexibility the dc is able to provide with respect to service level agreements (slas) deadlines (keller et al. 2020). vieira et al. (2015) distinguish between three levels of flexibility handling dc services requests: (i) “fixed-time requests “ (no flexibility), (ii) “floating-time requests “ (partly temporally flexible, e.g., interruptible), and (iii) “variable-time requests” (temporally flexible). overall, current literature on energy-efficient dcs seems to be focused on lowering the electricity bill and the carbon-footprint of a dc.",0
"regarding (renewable) iess, literature specifically addresses two streams. on the one hand, iess play an important role in remote areas where reliability is important in the subsystem (kanase-patil et al. 2010). on the other hand, storage options for an efficient use of res offer new prospects for iess, which are especially discussed with respect to electricity battery storage (connolly et al. 2012) and power conversion in power-to-x plants (glenk and reichelstein 2019). research suggests that power-to-x plants converting electricity into a storable good like hydrogen or fuel may play an important role in future energy systems with their property to store electricity and use it in a flexible manner (bai et al. 2016; glenk and reichelstein 2020). within the energy research community, this research stream is also sometimes referred to and considered using the term smart energy systems (lund et al. 2017). to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a model and an evaluation for an integration of an res-plant and a dc.",0
"finally, regarding energy flexibility, research considers the concept of dr as a possible subset of demand-side management and as a possible key element for tackling the challenge of grid stability for decades (gellings 1985; palensky and dietrich 2011). here, literature defines dr as the adaption of a load profile given, e.g., time-varying electricity market price signals (palensky and dietrich 2011). in this way, dr is a form of energy flexibility on the demand side (haupt et al. 2020). research repeatedly stresses the crucial role of is for an efficient dr (fridgen et al. 2020; kahlen et al. 2018; körner et al. 2019). consequently, also is research addresses the topic of load shifting. for example, fridgen et al. (2016) assess the value of is-enabled flexibility on the demand side, with a focus on electric vehicles. gelazanskas and gamage (2014) further elaborate on what information is needed to decide on specific dr measures. is research also analyses how dr can be used to gain a financial advantage in various markets, e.g., on the electricity spot market (jäckle et al. 2019). in the light of energy flexibility, dr may, therefore, help to increase the overall efficiency of an energy system, while at the same time reduce the cost of energy demand for consumers (paulus and borggrefe 2011). against this background, our work contributes to this research stream by illustrating that an ies supplying flexibility is applicable and economically viable.",0
"to answer our research question, we follow the research cycle proposed by meredith et al. (1989) that is widely used in is research (banz et al. 2016; bürger et al. 2017). according to meredith et al. (1989), model development should build on a research cycle consisting of three stages, namely the description, the explanation, and the testing stage. accordingly, we develop a model that describes investment decisions in the ies and the optimal usage of the ies in sect. 3.2 (also cf. appendix a; available online via http://link.springer.com). our model is based upon analytical modeling, as we assume a rational utilization of the ies (meredith et al. 1989). to test our model, we evaluate it with real-world data in sect. 5. in the following, we consider all three stages of the research cycle in more detail.",0
"meredith et al. (1989) state that the description stage is essential for model development as it characterizes the examined system. in line with such approach, we introduce and locate our ies into relevant fields of research that we identify in the literature (sect. 2). furthermore, we describe how the ies relates to similar technological systems in research, especially with respect to power-to-x plants.",0
"the explanation stage is characterized by developing the causal structures or complex relationships of a system. we constantly shift backward and forward between the description and the explanation stage in sect. 3.2, as new aspects of the examined system are first described and then analyzed, as suggested by meredith et al. (1989). in the light of meredith et al. (1989), our analysis classifies as rational and artificial in analyzing the operation of an ies. we do so by conducting formal deductive quantitative modeling in sect. 3.2. our model assumes an investor, who acts as an economic agent that chooses the investment in the respective plants maximizing the npv (hirshleifer 1958). building the basic framework for our model, we utilize the approach presented by glenk and reichelstein (2019), who identify an optimal investment decision into an ies consisting of an res-plant and a power-to-gas plant. subsequently, in line with meredith et al. (1989), we illustrate the impact of our ies on promoting res-plants.",0
"in the testing stage, we examine the identified model along with a more detailed description of the situations that the testing is based on (meredith et al. 1989). we begin the testing stage in sect. 4 by describing how the application of aws instances for ml and bitcoin mining fits the examined relationships and stating the specific assumptions for the testing. we then quantitively apply our model in line with taylor (2005) and describe the results in sect. 5. subsequently, we discuss the results in light of our rq and illustrate the contributions of our paper.",1
"based on the methodological approach described above, we first introduce the setup of our ies. we then briefly define the most relevant variables/parameters and derive the mathematical representation for an optimal investment decision. figure 1 depicts the specific setup of the ies. the res-plant (1) generates electricity that is either sold on the electricity market (2) or consumed within the ies by a dc (3). the dc thus consumes either electricity bought from the electricity market or electricity generated within the ies to execute computations, which are then compensated for by an external market (4). the ies itself consists of (1) and (3); hence the ies’s system border relates to the connections between the ies and the respective markets (2) and (4). the relevant electricity market referred to in this work is the electricity spot market.",1
"based on these operation modes, the npv of an ies as our objective function writes as follows (bars indicate a variable’s mean; see appendices a and b for further details):",0
"in the testing stage of our methodological approach, we evaluate our model with real-world data. our ies may be applicable for a variety of use-cases, i.e., the plant that is to be integrated with the res-plant may take a wide variety of different forms. these forms may range from production plants that convert electricity into physical goods to more is-related forms, such as the conversion of electricity into computational power by a dc. with respect to the latter, we evaluate two specific use-cases that differ concerning their ratio between electricity input and product sales price, namely aws (on-demand) instances for training ml algorithms and the mining of bitcoin. while for these specific use-cases this ratio is much higher for bitcoin mining as compared to aws instances, we note that this may result from distorted (high) prices for using aws instances. in this context, recent trends within the ml industry may lead to electricity costs becoming much more relevant for training ml algorithms (sze et al. 2017). however, we note that today’s aws on-demand prices do only depict a relatively small ratio between electricity input and product sales price. moreover, we note that slas may prevent the operator from idling the dc because of direct costs (due to sla breaches) or indirect costs (due to lower customer satisfaction as a result of downtimes). however, regarding our evaluation, we consider the two use-cases to execute”variable-time requests” that may be shifted temporally in line with keller et al. (2020) and vieira et al. (2015). in the following, we give some more details on the two exemplary use-cases.",0
"ml – as a subset of artificial intelligence – provides entities with the possibility to compute human-like decisions by algorithms being able to produce knowledge by generalizing from examples, i.e., relations in exemplary data (domingos 2012; kratsch et al. 2020). the field has grown new interest over the past years in both, research and practice. a variety of computing algorithms exist that “learn” a new model based on an existing data set, e.g., to predict unknown data. this utilization of computing power also fits the setup of an ies as the learning needs not to take place at a specific time but may instead be shifted based on external market signals, in this context, specifically electricity market prices. hence, we reflect it as temporally flexible in the sense of vieira et al. (2015) – which may be some simplification with interesting future research opportunities. furthermore, research critically evaluates the increasingly high demand for ml use-cases and the corresponding energy demand (jobin et al. 2019). aws is the largest operator of cloud computing capacity and offers a variety of computing instances that are specifically designed to run ml applications. therefore, its setup may serve as a use-case for an evaluation of our work.",0
"bitcoin mining constitutes the process of creating bitcoins as well as validating transactions within the bitcoin system (nakamoto 2008). in order to be allowed to add a new block to the blockchain, a network participant must prove that the user has solved the according hashcash. a hashcash constitutes a cryptographic problem that is designed to be arbitrarily difficult to solve; if a solution is found, it can easily be verified whether the provided solution is correct or not. the only opportunity to solve a hashcash is that a computing machine randomly tries possible answers until the right one is met (narayanan and clark 2017). this process makes bitcoin mining extraordinarily energy-intensive (sedlmeir et al. 2020). however, we note that not all blockchain applications may solely be regarded as energy-intensive consumers (albrecht et al. 2018). for example, nieße et al. (2018) reflect blockchain as a technology to manage parts of the energy system by introducing a blockchain-based system for congestion management. moreover, for example, utz et al. (2019) propose a blockchain-based smart contract system for shared energy assets, while wu and tran (2018) review several blockchain applications, e.g., for carbon emissions certification and trading. regarding our evaluation, bitcoin mining is not only implementable in practice, but the bitcoin price also allows for an immediate price determination for the product corresponding to the energy input. additionally, the operation of bitcoin mining may be time-independent, i.e., adjustable to electricity generation or electricity prices without consumption catch-up effects. thus, bitcoin mining is utilized as a second evaluation case.",0
"regarding the ml-case, we additionally assume a dc output price in line with the publicly available on-demand utilization prices for ml instances provided by aws (see appendix c). we calculate electricity usage and costs based on the energy consumption of the associated hardware stack, including the respective investments. to incorporate overhead server energy consumption, i.e., cooling and memory, we add a surcharge of 70% on the dc’s processing chip energy consumption in line with dayarathna et al. (2016). as (i) the specific cost structure and the respective energy consumption of an aws server stack is not publicly available, and (ii) the modeling of highly specific costs, e.g., costs for switching on and off or stand-by costs of the idle dc, yields a high model complexity due to discrete decisions (dayarathna et al. 2016), we simplify these costs and assume that they are included in the fixed operating costs. in line with fridgen et al. (2017), we further assume that the energy consumption of the dc is proportional to its load operated. considering research and practice, we note that there are several promising approaches demonstrating and further improving the proportionality between a dc’s processing capacity and its load (gandhi et al. 2010; ganesh et al. 2013; lin et al. 2013; tolia et al. 2008; whitney and delforge 2014). however, we also note that this assumption may limit the accuracy of our numerical results but does not affect their general explanatory power. to address this issue, we conducted sensitivity analyses regarding the input factors, e.g., costs for equipment, especially overhead costs, or energy consumption of this equipment, (for example, of cooling servers). some dcs also utilize significant shares of electricity when they are idle, which is why we increased fixed operating costs by 50%, 100%, and 200%. the operation modes and corresponding results presented hereinafter do not change significantly (cf. sect. 5.2 and 5.3), whereas the npv of the investment as well as the optimal dc capacity shrinks due to increased costs.",0
"regarding the bc-case, we evaluate the model with bitcoin price data and the respective mining network characteristics, i.e., mining difficulty, block reward, and transaction fee, based on publicly available sources (see appendix d). we base our assumptions regarding costs and computational power on mining hardware that was available at the beginning of the observation period to ensure coherent results. we maintain the assumption of proportionality between the dc load and the corresponding energy consumption as stated above.",1
"for the investment in an ies, we assume that the res-plant either sells its electricity to the electricity market or the electricity is locally consumed in the integrated dc. as we already described above, the npv of the stand-alone ml-dc may be positive (due to high ml conversion values). our results thus illustrate that the npv of an ies, consisting of an res-plant and a ml-dc, yields a positive npv alike. the ies does not feed-in electricity into the grid at any time, but it uses the generated electricity locally for the integrated ml-dc. this effectively results in the absence of operation mode 1 of the model. it corresponds to expectations from real-world observations, as dc services are normally not deactivated by providers due to high electricity costs. the result for the ml-case demonstrates that the integration indeed yields synergistic effects, i.e., the npv of the ies is higher than the sum of the npv of the two stand-alone plants. this may effectively reduce the electricity bill for operating the energy-intensive ml application. furthermore, the utilization of the res-plant may increase as its generated electricity may also be used in the ml-dc at times when the selling price for electricity drops below 0. this effect is accompanied by an increase in the share of res that is utilized within the ml-dc in comparison to the stand-alone case (utilizing only market electricity), resulting in a decrease of the dc’s carbon-footprint. the conducted sensitivity analyses suggest that the optimal investment size remains the same, whereas the npv of the ies is lower in case of higher fixed costs, e.g., the npv is reduced by 9% if the fixed costs are increased by 100%. the synergistic value persists as well.",0
depiction of npv of the ies that consists of an res-plant and a bitcoin mining plant (on the left) and the npv of the same ies assuming higher maintenance costs for the res-plant (on the right),1
"to sum up, both use-cases, the ml-case and the bitcoin-case, yield positive npvs resulting in the promotion of res-plants. moreover, when integrated with an res-plant, the bitcoin mining plant is able to provide significant demand-side flexibility.",1
"based on the modeling and evaluation in the previous sections, we summarize first research contributions of our work as well as first insights for practice and decision-makers.",0
"concerning the contribution to is research, our results build on research on optimizing energy costs of dcs, on research on reducing the carbon-footprint of dcs (green it), and on research on how to use it-infrastructure to increase the sustainability of the energy system (green is) as described in sect. 5. moreover, our work contributes to the research stream on is-enabled energy flexibility, see, e.g., kahlen et al. (2014), fridgen et al. (2016), and keller et al. (2020). our ies constitutes a new way of providing (local) energy demand-side flexibility. such flexibility results from the operation mode of the ies reacting to electricity market signals, i.e., electricity prices; if market signals indicate that overall electricity feed-in is (too) high, i.e., electricity prices are low or negative, the ies’s electricity will be used by the integrated dc and the overall amount of electricity in the system decreases. our evaluation suggests that the more relevant electricity costs of the converted good are, as compared to its output price, the more sensitively the ies operates with respect to external electricity market signals (see sect. 5). this may be of particular interest as recent trends suggest that the relevance of electricity costs for ml applications will increase significantly. furthermore, we also contribute to is-research and theory by building on the work of watson et al. (2010). our ies provides new opportunities for increasing the efficiency of flow networks as introduced by watson et al. (2010), given that the ies supplies local flexibility by converting excess electricity on-site into computational power. in this sense, our approach may help to use flow networks more efficiently by implementing is applications, e.g., an ies. in addition, both parts of our ies, the res-plant as well as the integrated dc, may constitute sensitized objects. in this context, our research also contributes to further developing use-cases for the concept of edge computing as the ies may shift computational power towards the edges of the network. this may be particularly relevant for research focusing on topics of sustainable edge computing (li et al. 2018). moreover, we contribute to research by transferring approaches from outside the is-community, i.e., glenk and reichelstein (2019), into the field of ei. we develop an economic model for an ies that reflects is cases in which the consuming part of the ies is a dc.",0
"our work is also highly relevant for practice and decision-makers when reflecting on the implementation of iess. in our evaluation, we illustrate that the ies performs well for practical settings, e.g., for ml and for bitcoin mining as examples for (energy-intensive) applications. in both cases, the ies has a positive npv, i.e., the operation of the res-plant and the dc within the ies is economically viable. we also analyze the situation where the npv of a stand-alone res-plant is negative, e.g., due to high fixed maintenance costs or due to the expiration of subsidy programs, resulting in a situation where a (further) operation of the res-plant on its own may not be economically viable (friedemann 2018; ziegler et al. 2018). for such cases, our results illustrate that the npv of the ies may be positive even if the npv of both, the stand-alone res-plant and the respective dc, is negative. moreover, as highlighted above, our work will also be increasingly relevant for companies that deal with ml applications, reflecting that energy costs for ml will increase within the next years, and its usage may be shifted temporally. in summary, as our ies has a higher npv compared to the stand-alone plants, it may increase investments in res-plants by tackling uncertainties of res-plant operators concerning income in time periods with low electricity prices. from an overall energy-system perspective, the res generation could be promoted through a corresponding integration with an energy-intensive dc.",1
"in this paper, we present an economic model that illustrates how the integration of an res-plant with an energy-intensive dc into an ies may increase the economic viability of an res-plant operation. we evaluate our model by applying two use-cases, namely, ml and bitcoin mining to make use of the dc. our results illustrate that the npv of the ies can be higher than the npv of the stand-alone res-plant as well as of a stand-alone dc. we argue that a higher npv of an ies may promote investments in res-plants. especially with respect to the prevalent negative correlation between res generation and electricity market prices, the ies could tackle uncertainties for res-plant operators concerning their income in times of low electricity prices. moreover, we argue that our ies is also be able to contribute to grid stability by supplying flexibility. we also note that the dc – when used within the ies – may consume a higher share of res and thus distinctly reduce its own carbon-footprint. overall, we conclude that our ies promotes the operation of res-plants by integrating energy-intensive dcs.",1
"given our first results, we briefly sketch some limitations of our work. in general, our methodology in terms of application-oriented modeling inhibits limitations itself, including a simplification of a real-world application and the exclusion of specific contextual factors such as the need for a timely execution of computing services. these factors may be incorporated as sla costs or deadlines that introduce additional constraints to the model at hand. our evaluation use-cases may limit our results as they are based on specific economic parameters and assumptions that may differ when assessing other applications. for example, we base our ml-evaluation on several assumptions concerning the costs of operating a dc, however, the cost structure of aws server stacks is not publicly available. moreover, we simplify the economics of a mining plant in our evaluation; in particular, we assume that a large part of the dc has no recovery value at the end of the three-year term, whereas the future use in reality is rather complex. for example, the utilization of the mining processor may become obsolete due to future mining difficulties or new mining technologies. in such cases, the equipment may still well be utilized in application areas with lower electricity prices and therefore sold to other operators. in consequence, specific assumptions of our evaluation cases may not fit generic real-world applications, which may require a more detailed consideration of additional (technical) constraints of an ies operation.",0
"our work also provides various starting points for further research that may extend our approach, for example, by considering other markets or the interconnection between the ies and the grid in more detail. here, research may address the above limitations by applying additional use-cases and corresponding markets, e.g., control energy markets. reflecting and incorporating the value of addressing several markets with one ies may constitute the basis for the development of specific decision support systems for operators. further research may also quantify the ies’s contribution to addressing grid stability issues in full details. moreover, further research may consider specific cost structures of dcs in all their particulars. with respect to further ei research, we suggest reflecting the role of edge computing in the light of consuming electricity locally as it inherently shifts electricity consumption towards the edges of a computing grid. moreover, future work may also discuss relevant implications for policymakers, e.g., analyze whether and which kinds of subsidy programs for promoting res-plants (that typically bear huge costs for the general public) are needed under consideration of concepts like iess. here, our first results suggest that the implementation of (new) subsidy programs, especially feed-in tariffs, may reduce synergistic effects of the ies. feed-in tariffs generally entail higher opportunity costs for the operator of an ies when consuming the electricity within the ies. against this background, our work may serve as a profound starting point for future research in the highly relevant field of ei.",1

"you’ll hear that most bitcoin mining is powered by renewables. the numbers on this tend to be fuzzy. since many mining operations are migratory, energy sources can change seasonally. in china, where some 65% of bitcoin mining is currently done, miners set up near hydroelectric sources during the rainy season, then revert to coal-powered electricity.",1

"while wyoming is known for fossil fuel extraction, the state has the capacity to generate 1,653,856 gwh of wind per year. with the growing rate of greenhouse gas emissions and the cyclical boom-bust that the state faces, there is an opportunity for private sector investment and a state and federal government that can utilize the overgeneration capacity of wind in wyoming for bitcoin mining operations and carbon capture, utilization and storage. currently, projects are under development, but the issue of overgenerated wind continues to exist. by harnessing the overgenerated wind for bitcoin mining, wyoming has the opportunity to redistribute the global hashrate, incentivize bitcoin miners to move their operations to wyoming, and stimulate job growth as a result. carbon capture, utilization, and storage could help propel bitcoin mining operations as well as harness carbon to manufacture products across various industries. by assessing workforce characteristics and proposed federal policies, this research addresses the need for the implementation of the endless frontier act with the inclusion of wind turbine and ccs development, workforce protection, and cryptocurrency incentives.",1

"renewable energy sources such as wind power are increasing their share of the world energy matrix. in brazil, the regulator promotes reverse bid auctions where the winner agrees to begin production a number of years ahead under a long-term contract. if a wind farm project chooses to anticipate construction, it can sell its energy in the short-term market but becomes subject to electricity price volatility. in order to create incentives for early investment, we propose that wind farm investors can hedge electricity price risk by simultaneously investing in a cryptocurrency mining facility that uses electricity as input to produce newly minted bitcoins. as electricity and bitcoin prices are uncorrelated, the ability to switch between these outputs allows the wind farm to maximize revenues and minimize losses. we develop a numerical application under the real options approach to determine the financial impact of the investment in a bitcoin facility for the wind energy producer that will allow it to optimally switch outputs depending on the relative future prices of electricity and bitcoins. the short-term energy price and bitcoin price/mining-difficulty ratio are modeled as distinct stochastic diffusion processes. the results indicate that the option to switch outputs significantly increases the generator's revenue while simultaneously decreasing the risk of anticipating the construction. these findings, which can also be applied to other renewable energy sources, may be of interest to both the energy generator as well as the system regulator as it creates an incentive for early investment in sustainable and renewable energy sources.",1

"the suddenly popular electronic currency is drawing the ire of skeptics. and trying to explain how bitcoin works and where it comes from to non-geeks only tends to raise eyebrows, but it's easiest to think of this way: when bitcoin was created by a shadowy programmer or group named satoshi nakamoto in 2009, a limit of 21 million coins were scattered throughout the digital realm and hidden in blocks of data. successfully unlocking these equations with computer software, or ""mining,"" yields a haul of bitcoins.",1
"but bitcoin mining ain't easy. while you can purchase coins outright (hence its fluctuating value), the actual process of mining is ""supposed to be arduous,"" says bloomberg, like extracting gold or diamonds from the earth. while you're not climbing down treacherous dig sites with a helmet, per se, you are dedicating a significant amount of computing power to solving what are essentially complex math problems.",1
"not just any old pc will do, either: dedicated bitcoin mining rigs with the sole purpose of crunching through algorithms can cost you up to $6,000 on ebay.",1
"then there's the fact that your chances of finding coins solo are incredibly slim. miners can go many fruitless months before they ever hear a coin's hypnotic clink. for that very reason, most users join mining pools, which combine the processing power of multiple machines and distribute any bounty among members, depending on how much work they've contributed.",0
"from an economic standpoint, that division of labor is partly why bitcoin mining can get to be so expensive. according to bloomberg, which uses data from a tracking site called blockchain.info, 24 hours of mining from around the world consumes in the ballpark of $150,000 in electricity. that works out to 15 cents per kilowatt hour — a little higher than the u.s. average, and enough to power roughly 31,000 u.s. homes.",1
"at least for now, though, the bitcoin mining industry remains profitable business for the truly dedicated. (a recent 24-hour period of work yielded bitcoin miners around the globe $681,000 profit.) but as more bitcoins are discovered, the odds of finding new ones will exponentially diminish. that's why, even though about half of the global bitcoin yield has already been pocketed, the last few probably won't be unlocked until 2030.",1
"as techcrunch cautions, ""while you could simply set a machine aside and have it run the algorithms endlessly, the energy cost and equipment deprecation will eventually cost more than the actual bitcoins are worth."" that's why, ""as with most gold rushes throughout history, it's those who are supplying the miners that are finding the real riches.""",1
"ave effectively lost your bitcoins. this feature encrypts your private keys and prevents bitcoins being sent from your address without an authorisation with the passphrase. this means if someone gains physical access to your machine, or an air gapped physical storage, they will be able to see the contents of your wallet, including your address, but they will not be able to steal your coins without breaking the encryption – which is not trivial.",1
"just over a week ago, fr33 aid, an anarchist mutual aid organisation that is centred around supporting volunteers who provide medical and educational services, had it’s bitcoins stolen from it’s online wallet located at blockchain.info.",1
"approximately 23 bitcoins were taken, with a value of about 14,500 usd. no small sum. this theft occurred despite reasonable safety measures undertaken by fr33 aid on the blockchain.info site. including the use of two factor authentication. this kind of event is not new. frequently we are given stories of bitcoins being stolen from people’s wallets. this has happened at coinbase, it happened to mtgox to the tune of $500 million dollars, which ultimately brought down the exchange, and it also happened to fr33 aid’s account at blockchain.info.",1
the common theme in all of these is that the wallets were stored in online accounts. storing ones bitcoins in an online wallet on a third party server is one of a few options that users of the cryptocurrency have. in keeping with my argument that internet security is our responsibility i will argue that a locally stored wallet should be the option used by those who wish to keep their bitcoins safe.,1
"while there are no shortages of horror stories to be found from people who have lost bitcoins from local storage due to malware or data loss, this can be mitigated and potentially eliminated by following best practices. the issue with online third party storage is that we are required to trust that they are undertaking best practices, in cases such as mtgox, where poor practices were followed, many found out too late.",1
"probably the most secure way to protect your bitcoins from online theft is to have it air gapped, ie on a device that is not connected to the internet. an example could be to place your wallet on a thumb drive, and put it in a safe place. if you are using a linux os, taking the extra step of encrypting the thumb drive is trivial while formatting the drive. while safe, this is probably best if you are only collecting bitcoins, or if you want to use it to store the majority of your bitcoins while using a secondary wallet for frequent transactions, because while you are still able to be on the receiving end of transactions, you must physically find the thumb drive, and break the air gap before using it. there is also the issue of losing the physical media – which thumb drives appear especially prone.",0
"a practical middle ground that i endorse is a multi-factor solution that uses a few simple tools to keep your wallet secure from theft and from coin loss. it’s not particularly revolutionary, and these basic principles are outlined on bitcoin.org. here is a simple specific example of how to undertake these steps.",1
"when using bitcoin core, the first step to securing your wallet is to use the encryption feature in the wallet. this can be accessed from settings > encrypt wallet.",1
"such a simple feature protects against coin theft, though coin loss presents a far greater risk than theft. so we move on to backing up our wallet. online storage is far more convenient than physical storage, and less prone to loss. often these storage solutions are not secure, so when backing up a wallet, an extra level of security is not to be disregarded.",1
"choose a save location and save. this creates a copy of your ‘wallet.dat’ which contains your private keys. an extremely secure solution to back this up is to use pgp to encrypt and email the file to yourself. this has a number of advantages, as it obscures the fact that you are even sending a wallet backup, meaning it will be less likely to be targeted by a malicious entity. you can use a keyword in the subject line of the email to make it searchable later, it will automatically time-stamp the email. this is important because right now because you will need to create a new backup if you create a new address within your wallet. if you have mulitple email accounts using pgp, you can automatically have a copy saved in each account.",1
"if you do not wish to set up pgp, another solution is to take your wallet.dat and encrypt it with winrar/rar. to encrypt a file using rar, on most machines will involve right clicking on the file and selecting “add to archive”. from here select the advanced tab, and then set password.",0
"as always, a strong passphrase is crucial. checking the obscure file names box will increase security by concealing the existence of the wallet backup from any potential attacker. from here you can take this encrypted compressed file and place it in some online storage such as dropbox, or email it to yourself for safe keeping.",0
"technologically there is nothing stopping cryptocurrencies from changing the world, bypassing the need for conventional banking systems and flouting government regulation of commerce. we just need some great minds to implement this, and we need people to have the confidence to adopt it.",1
"following these steps is just one way to conveniently access your wallet while at the same time keeping your bitcoins safe from theft or loss. the future of crytocurrency is predicated on trust and confidence in the system. over time, better integrated solutions are likely to be developed for wallet security. in the meantime keeping ourselves safe from loss and theft not only benefits us personally, but also creates better confidence in the concept of cryptocurrencies, and ensures a more robust future for these technologies.",1
"bitcoin has mesmerized academics, computer scientists and economists alike, for cutting out the paypals and governments usually required for digital money. finally, researchers have an official setting to nerd out in. tuesday, the university of pittsburgh launched the first bitcoin-only journal, ledger, which tackles the interdisciplinary world of cryptocurrency research.",1
"the peer-reviewed academic journal will cover technical, social, economic, and philosophical cryptocurrency developments. a paper might address, for instance, the new cryptocurrency algorithm designs, or a macroeconomic study.",1
the idea was born during a discussion between managing editors dr. peter r. rizun and prof. christopher e. wilmer on the bitcoin forum bitcointalk.org.,1

"you might ask, how much bitcoin research can there possibly be? bitcoin has seen scrolls of papers, exploring everything from improving information propagation across the bitcoin network to advice for regulating cryptocurrency-inspired financial instruments. ledger’s editors argue that cryptocurrency is too sprawling of a field of study for any “traditional journal.”",1
"“i wanted to build an academic and interdisciplinary communication channel that would allow bright minds in economics, sociology, physics, law and political science to contribute at the highest-level towards the evolution of bitcoin,” rizun said.",1
ledger was launched in 2015 to address the growing need for a traditional academic journal dedicated to cryptocurrency research. ledger aims to encourage greater involvement by academics in cryptocurrency and foster a culture of rigorous analysis and peer-review within the bitcoin community. it also aims to spur the aggregation and filtering of important content generated across relevant communication channels. the journal strives to serve both the general public and the bitcoin research community through the dissemination of high-quality and timely scholarly content. ledger is published online on a biannual basis in an open-access format by the university of pittsburgh.,1

he said the organisation would also uphold existing donor protocols – so those making donations online would have to pass rigorous checks before they were allowed to deposit funds to unicef.,0
"according to the annual report of the giving block, which makes it easy for potential donors to donate different types of crypto, the total yearly volume of crypto donations it received grew by 1,558% in 2021, compared to 2020.",1
"in addition, the average crypto donation was approximately $10,455, as opposed to the average cash donation of $128, or 82 times greater value per transaction. the giving block currently helps more than 1,000 mission-driven organizations, charities, universities, and faith-based organizations of all sizes to accept cryptocurrency donations – and says it has helped them raise millions.",1
"orangutan outreach is one such organization that utilizes the giving block's platform to raise donations through crypto. the non-profit's mission is to protect, rescue, and help rehabilitate critically endangered orangutans. founder and executive director rich zimmerman said that 2021 was a turning point for the organization's stance on crypto donations.",1
"""we started accepting crypto around early 2020 and found very little overlap between our traditional donor base and our crypto donor base,"" he said. ""[the crypto space] is a brilliant new world of people, many of whom are interested and care about the issues and actually make donations.""",1
"but zimmerman said that what really got the ball rolling on their crypto journey was when last summer nft pioneer, bored ape yacht club (bayc), made a string of donations that equated to the largest contribution to orangutan outreach in the non-profit's history. those donations sparked a greater interest in the nft space, and julius was born.",0
"""julius is our bored ape ambassador, and he has become our representative and avatar across our social media, putting our name out there to people who otherwise would not have known about us or what we do,"" zimmerman said.",0
"he added that it's important to note that julius is privately owned and was not purchased by orangutan outreach, adding that the cartoon ape nft is used strictly for marketing and fundraising purposes. julius spearheads the 'bored in borneo' initiative, which involves orangutan conservation and massive reforestation work across indonesian borneo.",1
"the giving block's report noted that nft might be the single more significant development from 2021 as far as charities and crypto go, with more than $12.3m in donations made from known nft projects.",1
"orangutan outreach is hardly alone in accepting crypto; other charities like unicef, st. jude, save the children, and others have also begun to accept cryptocurrency donations, and so do all 10 out of the top 10 charities listed as america's top 100 charities of 2021 by forbes.",1
"however, crypto donations have gotten some backlash because of the massive amounts of energy blockchain mining uses. for example, the annual use of electricity to power just bitcoin alone is reportedly 134 twh.",1
"""we are aware that there are issues, and we hope and expect that the technology will continue to improve,"" zimmerman says. ""however, we look at crypto as a revenue stream, and we don't have the luxury of saying no to someone who wants to adopt an orangutan with ethereum,"" he adds.",1
"""education and awareness are how we approach the nft space,"" zimmerman says. ""there are people that want to do good with whatever money they have, and we have to acknowledge that.""",1
"but orangutan outreach isn't the only animal-focused non-profit that has utilized the crypto space: recently the uk division of the world wildlife fund (wwf) began to sell nfts themed around endangered species to finance conservation efforts. the move was almost immediately met with backlash on social media, and the organization chose to discontinue selling nfts shortly after.",1
"""this work with nfts was planned as a trial to test a new fundraising stream. we agreed with our partners to bring this to a close,"" a wwf spokesperson said. ""we recognize that nfts are a much-debated issue and we all have lots to learn about this new market, which is why we will now fully assess the impact of this trial and reflect on how we can best continue to innovate to engage our supporters.""",1
"and just before that, in january, the non-profit mozilla foundation said it was going to 'pause' the ability to accept cryptocurrency donations after one of its founders criticised its willingness to accept 'planet-incinerating' cryptocurrency.",1
"riley adams, a licensed certified public accountant and senior financial analyst at google, told zdnet that there are ways for charities to work around the unethical implications of crypto.",1
"""if the concerns mount for the environmental concerns posed by crypto, actively shortlisting which coins a charity will accept based on environmental impact can virtue signal their dislike for pollution while also accepting financial resources for their efforts,"" adams said. ""choosing which [crypto] to accept or decline is a step around the environmental concerns some coins pose.",1
"for example, there are more sustainable crypto options such as nano, ripple, and cardano that use less energy than cryptos like bitcoin. in addition, ethereum is currently working on upgrading its system to a proof-of-stake, which uses less energy than the proof-of-work method the blockchain uses, by q2 of this year.",1
"zimmerman also sees cryptocurrency as an inevitable asset, not only to his organization, but the world of non-profits moving forward. he said that just as paypal changed the game for fundraising by allowing online donations over sending cash and checks in the mail, crypto is doing the same thing.",1

"on the shores of seneca lake in upstate new york, a private equity company has bought a decommissioned coal power plant and converted it to burn natural gas. it then switched it back on to become what it describes as a “power plant-cryptocurrency mining hybrid”.",1
"greenidge generation holdings, the company behind the plant, plans to go public later this year, saying it expects to become “the only us publicly listed bitcoin mining operation with its own power source”.",1
"in a presentation to investors, it says its direct line in to the empire pipeline system for gas allows it to produce coins for just $3,000 a pop — a hefty margin considering that even after a heavy recent drop on a possible crackdown from chinese regulators, they sell for about $40,000.",1
"the company says it is proud of shifting away from coal. it is looking to buy more power plants and vastly scale up operations. climate activists, however, are aghast that fossil fuels will be burnt to mine crypto, and are pushing regulators to clamp down on this and other similar projects to prevent a surge in greenhouse gas emissions.",1
"but no activist has so far had such a profound impact on awareness of bitcoin’s carbon question as elon musk, the tesla chief executive so fond of bitcoin that he loaded up his corporate coffers with $1.5bn of the cryptocurrency.",1
"musk said last week he had changed his mind, and reversed plans outlined in february to accept bitcoin for payments for his vehicles. “cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment,” he said.",1
"the statement generated a backlash from bitcoin believers, some of whom have made huge returns from early bets on the asset class and see it as the future of money. crypto proponents have accused him of ignorance over mining methods or of seeking to protect the shadowy interests of big government. a new crypto coin named “fuckelon” has appeared.",1
"to academics who for years have been measuring bitcoin’s energy intensity, however, musk has simply pointed out an established truth, albeit in his eccentric manner. it is a question so far largely ignored by governments, by heavy-hitting environmental charities, and by the banks and exchanges that facilitate the vast cryptocurrency industry.",1
"“bitcoin alone consumes as much electricity as a medium-sized european country,” says professor brian lucey at trinity college dublin. “this is a stunning amount of electricity. it’s a dirty business. it’s a dirty currency.”",1
"economic authorities are starting to take notice. the european central bank on wednesday described cryptoassets’ “exorbitant carbon footprint” as “grounds for concern”. in a paper earlier this month, italy’s central bank said the eurozone’s payments system, tips, had a carbon footprint 40,000 times smaller than that of bitcoin in 2019.",1
"measuring precisely how dirty bitcoin is has become a cottage industry in itself. the latest calculation from cambridge university’s bitcoin electricity consumption index suggests that bitcoin mining consumes 133.68 terawatt hours a year of electricity — a best-guess tally that has risen consistently for the past five years. that places it just above sweden, at 131.8twh of electricity usage in 2020, and just below malaysia, at 147.21twh.",1
"the true figure for bitcoin could in fact be much higher; cambridge’s extreme worst-case scenario calculation, based on miners using the least energy-efficient computers on the market as long as the process is still profitable, has peeled away from its central estimate sharply since november last year as the price of bitcoin has rocketed. the rationale: a rising bitcoin price attracts new miners, and also means that mining with older, less efficient equipment, makes financial sense.",1
"the higher price also means the machines producing bitcoin are forced to complete ever-tougher puzzles in search of their quarry. at the upper limit, bitcoin’s electricity consumption would be about 500twh a year. the uk consumes 300twh. about 65 per cent of the crypto mining comes from china, where coal makes up around 60 per cent of the energy mix.",1
"naturally, there is space for disagreement on these statistics, and all studies on the issue accept elements of uncertainty. “there’s a lot of shades of grey,” says michel rauchs, a research affiliate who works on the cambridge index.",0
"rauchs points out that a slice of the mining in china comes from clean hydroelectric power, including with machines that are transported from the north to the south of the country on trucks each year in the wet season. that hydro power is not necessarily diverted from anywhere else; some of these power stations were founded for factories that no longer exist, rauchs says. in those cases, “i don’t see that it’s necessarily a problem”, he adds. about 75 per cent of miners use some kind of renewable energy, cambridge studies show, but renewables still account for less than 40 per cent of the total energy used. some mining may also be conducted off-grid, making it harder to track.",0
"all this nuance makes a difference. still, the possibility of global official intervention to cut the industry’s energy consumption is an “existential threat”, says rauchs.",0
"energy consumption on some scale is a feature, not a bug, of bitcoin — a digital currency launched by the pseudonymous satoshi nakamoto 12 years ago. its detachment from the global financial and governmental system — still the most alluring feature for users seeking anonymity or wishing to bypass central banks — means it needs a new way to establish trust and security.",1
"it does this by awarding miners coins in return for intensive puzzle-solving on the blockchain, making it a so-called “proof of work” coin. the puzzles are sufficiently hard to prevent hackers and other nefarious actors from taking control of the network, and the faster that miners can submit random numbers into the bitcoin algorithm, the more likely they are to unlock the coins. this all demands powerful machines running at full tilt.",1
"luckily for bitcoin miners with access to cheap energy and efficient machines, it is usually worth it. the price of bitcoin has dropped by about $30,000 apiece since the peak last month, but it has climbed by more than 200 per cent since late 2020 and more than 1,000 per cent since 2019.",1
"bitcoin is not the only energy-intensive cryptocurrency, but it is by far the biggest. others include litecoin, ether and the light-hearted but rapidly growing dogecoin — initially an internet joke based on a shiba inu dog.",1
"a march 2020 study by energy research journal joule said bitcoin accounted for about 80 per cent of the market capitalisation of “proof of work” coins, of which an estimated 500 exist, and about two-thirds of the energy. “understudied currencies add nearly 50 per cent on top of bitcoin’s energy hunger, which already alone may cause considerable environmental damage,” the study claimed.",1
"some cryptocurrencies are seeking to shift to a less energy-intensive “proof of stake” model, where a system allocates coins to verifiers, akin to miners, who put up coins for collateral. in the event of fraud, verifiers stand to lose their stakes, establishing trust through this channel rather than through energy-intensive “work”. ether, the cryptocurrency native to the ethereum blockchain network, has been working on a shift to this model for more than two years, but the project is dogged by technical difficulties. musk has also dangled the possibility that he could back other coins with a lighter energy impact.",1
"a greener version of bitcoin is, in theory, possible. bitcoin’s code could switch to a less energy-intensive consensus mechanism, whereby a new section of the blockchain ledger underlying the cryptocurrency would follow different rules. however, every miner would need to switch for the new path to work. industry insiders say it is hard to imagine the entire bitcoin community, which is peppered with disagreements, lending support to such a plan.",1
"other ideas, such as labelling individual bitcoins as clean or dirty depending on the energy used to mine them, would also be hard to verify, and create a two-tier bitcoin system that was likely to lack support.",1
"“bitcoin could be the first inefficient version of a disruptive technology,” says dr larisa yarovaya, a lecturer at southampton university. “it should die for the common good of the planet and be replaced by a new model. it consumes more electricity than a country. all the rest is detail.”",1
"yarovaya, a former russian paralympic swimmer, frequently fields criticisms of her analysis and motivations from bitcoin proponents. she is undeterred, however. “it’s common sense,” she says. “[the energy consumption] is not justifiable by the high price of bitcoin. it is a speculative asset. it does not create a substantial amount of employment. it’s not widely used for transactions.”",1
"such concerns have not, however, sparked high-profile campaigning from environmental groups. friends of the earth, an advocacy group, says it is still getting to grips with the issue, as is greenpeace, whose us arm started accepting bitcoin donations in 2014. after inquiries from the financial times, greenpeace says it will now scrap the facility, which has not been heavily used. “as the amount of energy needed to run bitcoin became clearer, this policy became no longer tenable,” says greenpeace.",1
"environmental concerns have also not deterred a clutch of investment banks from entering the sector, despite their public commitments to sustainable development goals: citigroup said recently it was exploring what role it could play in crypto services; goldman sachs has reopened bitcoin derivatives trading; and morgan stanley plans to offer clients access to bitcoin funds. none of these banks wished to comment on the issue of energy consumption.",1
"yarovaya says public companies dabbling in cryptocurrencies have served to “validate” the asset class, pumping up prices and in turn indirectly cranking up the energy usage. “they need to explain themselves,” she says, adding that cryptocurrency buyers should also take individual responsibility for their contribution.",1
"nigel topping, who was appointed by the uk government to co-ordinate with businesses over climate goals ahead of the cop26 talks later this year, says bitcoin is not likely to be on the agenda for climate discussions among governments in glasgow, but it is starting to become a real issue in broader policy discussions. “it’s becoming one of the climate baddies,” he says. “people who care about climate are in a bit of dismay. it’s just a silly idea. proof of work is proof of burning [fossil fuels]. it’s working directly against what we’re trying to do.”",1
"the un is also looking at ways it can prevent the growth of cryptocurrencies from undermining its work on climate change, and is supporting the “crypto climate accord” initiative, led by the rocky mountain institute, says topping. the group is not aiming to slow innovation in digital finance, but wants to ensure that future blockchain-based projects are designed to consume less energy.",1
"max boonen, a former banker and founder of cryptocurrency trading platform b2c2, says “there’s a cost” to the environment from this industry, some of which is balanced out by the benefits of bitcoin’s “censorship resistance”.",1
"do crypto market participants worry about the energy usage? “not in the slightest,” says boonen. “anyone in this market feels comfortable enough about the environmental costs. if you think it’s a problem, you don’t participate.” nonetheless boonen says he considers himself to be an environmentalist. he offsets some of the carbon involved in his work through “effective altruism”, such as donations to charities.",1
"bitcoin proponents remain convinced that the benefits outweigh the costs, arguing that cryptocurrencies provide the basis for the financial system of the future. some, such as jack dorsey’s square and cathie wood’s ark investment, argued in a white paper that the bitcoin network could in fact incentivise the more rapid development of renewable energy. “increasing bitcoin mining capacity could allow the energy provider to ‘overbuild’ solar without wasting energy,” the paper said.",1
"banks and asset managers keen to meet client demand for crypto services are looking at carbon offsets. much heavier reliance on renewable energy would soften the blow, but would still draw criticism by diverting clean power from other parts of society. after protests by residents and green ngos, the greenidge project in new york state announced plans to make its bitcoin generation carbon neutral by buying carbon credits. the company says it is “committed to exploring and investing in renewable energy initiatives across the country”.",1
"mandy deroche, an attorney at earthjustice, which is campaigning against this and other resurrections of what she calls “zombie” fossil fuel-based power plants, says greenidge buying credits is “irrelevant” considering the amount of greenhouse gases emitted, and the time has come for a more serious look at potential regulation.",0
"“people can get distracted by, like, ‘what is bitcoin and what does it do?’ honestly i don’t care what bitcoin does. i care that it is hugely energy-intensive, and that there are maybe better ways to go about bitcoin mining than this very inefficient, very energy-intensive process,” she says.",1

"so sometimes a bubble can be obvious and yet can persist for a long time. and in fact you can – i mean, you know, i've been saying that canadian housing is in a bubble for years, and it keeps going up. and so, i mean, the nice thing about calling a bubble is that you can always — if it doesn't burst, you can always say well it's just going to burst later. but i guess the question is how long can something like this go on with bitcoin?",0
"well, the thing about bitcoin is there isn't actually a whole lot of stuff… there's not — in a way the fact that it's completely untethered to anything real means that it doesn't fall until it … it can just hang there in mid-air for a long, long time. there's no obvious real — it's not like, you know, the housing crisis. if housing prices are unrealistic, then more housing gets built and you can see it. bitcoin — the cost of producing of new bitcoins has gone crazily high. so that's not going to happen. so we're waiting for a wylie coyote moment. you know, the cartoon physics, he runs off the edge of a cliff and it's only when he looks down and realizes there's nothing under him and he goes ... so we're waiting for that sort of thing to happen. and that can go on for a long time. you know, a bubble is a natural ponzi scheme, that's how bob shiller puts it. that it's — as long as it's going on everybody who bought in keeps making money and it looks good, and the fact that in the end somebody's going to be left holding the bag. everybody assumes it's not going to be them.",1

"bitcoin, an experiment with a radically new kind of electronic money, has exhibited many of the characteristics of a speculative bubble. that was clear long before the collapse of the bitcoin exchange mt. gox last week.",1
"the bitcoin phenomenon seems to fit the basic definition of a speculative bubble — that is, a special kind of fad, a mania for holding an asset in expectation of its appreciation. further, a bubble is publicized and amplified by news of price increases, often justified by some kind of inspiring “new era” story that attracts more attention as the price rises. in this case, the narrative was that a computer whiz invented a new kind of money in the form of electronic currency units, as part of a decentralized computer-driven system for a world economy that extends beyond the reach of any single government.",1
"the central problem with bitcoin in its present form, though, is that it doesn’t really solve any sensible economic problem. nor should it substitute for banks and the governmental institutions that regulate them. they are reasonably effective institutions, despite their flaws, and should not just be scrapped and replaced by a novel electronic system.",1
"unfortunately, the bitcoin success story has been tied intrinsically with instability, with excitement and envy for those who have become rich through investing in it — rich for a while at least, because the value of the electronic currency has fluctuated wildly. the instability of bitcoin’s value in dollars is a measure of failure, not success. it means that any commerce using bitcoin or its competitors would be buffeted by enormous inflation and deflation.",0
"but if we go back to the electronic-money drawing board, we may conclude that bitcoin has been focused on the wrong classical functions of money, as a medium of exchange and a store of value. bitcoin offers a way of “mining” electronic coins that can replace our dollar bills and bank accounts. yet there is no fundamental need for this. money, as we’ve known it for decades, works quite well in these respects. it would be much better to focus on another classical function: money as a unit of account — that is, as a basic standard of economic measurement. scientists spend a lot of time thinking about ways to improve systems of measurement. business people should, too.",1
"this has already begun to happen. history shows that this unit-of-account function of money has been separated from the other two, and to good purpose. for example, since 1967 in chile, an inflation-indexed unit of account called the unidad de fomento (u.f.), meaning unit of development, has been widely used. financial exchanges are made in pesos, according to a u.f.-peso rate posted on the website valoruf.cl. one multiplies the u.f. price by the exchange rate to arrive at the amount owed today in pesos. in this way, it is natural and easy to set inflation-indexed prices, and chile is much more effectively inflation-indexed than other countries are.",0
"consider rents. increases may seem unfair to tenants, yet they may be needed to offset inflation. in chile, a landlord can easily set the monthly rent for the tenant in u.f.s and then never have to change it, reducing the potential for errors, delays and misunderstandings. the name “u.f.” reframes people’s thinking so that keeping real economic values stable is natural and easy.",1
"a second improvement could be achieved by a credit card company or an entity like paypal or square cash: set up the electronic machinery to allow people to easily send conventional money, denominated in baskets, to anyone in the world. you would just check off a box indicating whether your payment was in dollars or pesos or euros — or baskets. if you check “baskets,” the computer would calculate the amount of local currency the recipient would need to buy that basket at that time, and it would transmit it, too.",1
"a third improvement would be to move beyond just one new unit of account to a whole system of them, so that we could have baskets for different purposes. there should be senior baskets representing items consumed by older people in one day in a given country, as well as subsistence baskets representing the consumption of the poor. there should also be a day-wage unit of account representing a day’s work by an average unskilled wage earner.",0
"and there could be a “trills” unit — a concept that mark kamstra of york university and i have been advocating — that represents one trillionth of a country’s most recently estimated annual g.d.p. there should also be a unit that grows or retreats with per-capita daily consumption. this could be used for pension and social security payments as a form of intergenerational risk-sharing: the idea is that payments to older people would rise and fall with overall consumption. with many kinds of baskets, it will be easier to set prices and make contracts that are sensible for the long term.",0
"these are ideas about simplification of complex economic calculations. but they are borrowed from behavioral economics, which has taught us that our actions are profoundly affected by framing — by the words we use and the approaches we take. and they are also ideas from cognitive linguistics, which implies that improved language, with new meanings for words like basket or day-wage, will change our thinking.",0

"in an answer to eco, richard thaler assures he does not make forecasts, but that there are historical proof of what might happen when irrationality in the markets creates an “abnormal” financial situation, providing the examples of the worldwide crash in october 1987, the technology bubble in the late 90s, and the real estate bubble in the early 2000s. “in ‘normal’ markets we would not observe such extreme events so often”, thaler warns, referring to the virtual coin’s abrupt valuation and devaluation movements.",1

"blockchain and smart contracts, hart added, echoing many in the banking industry, has potential as a useful technology.

"to sonei, the fall of one of the most valuable stablecoins — assets that were pitched as stable investments — is especially destabilizing to the crypto set.",1
"one luna influencer who goes by the twitter handle “wolf of defi,” told cnn that prior to the crash, around 90% of his net worth was tied up in luna and terra. the investor, who said he did not want to be publicly identified because of security concerns, described the crash as a “nightmare.”",1
"“i think no one, [including] me, ever thought it was possible to lose that much of money in a stablecoin. and i think that’s the biggest surprise ”",1
"in the terraluna community, many fans are fervent. and while one might think wolf of defi would be disillusioned after losing what he says was nearly all of his life savings, he says he’s still a proud lunatic.",0
"“i’ve never lost this much money in a few days in my life. i hope i never will again. but, i invested in a vision,” he said. “i am 100% sure i will do it all again. i can look myself in the mirror and it’s ok. it has been an honor to be part of the community. i will never leave the community.”",0
"“i understand the last 72 hours have been extremely tough on all of you - know that i am resolved to work with every one of you to weather this crisis, and we will build our way out of this,” he wrote on twitter.",0
kwon has come under scrutiny for having previously tweeted that some critics of luna were “poor.” terra did not respond to cnn’s request for comment.,0
"mike novogratz, founder and ceo of crypto fund galaxy digital, was one of the most prominent supporters of luna. he famously tweeted out a photo of a “luna” wolf tattoo in january and has been hyping up the cryptocurrency for months to his more than 457,000 twitter followers.",1

"bitcoin, a digital currency launched by the pseudonymous programmer satoshi nakamoto in 2009, hit a peak trading value of $266 per coin in april 2013, the biggest point in a bubble that would burst soon after.",1
"bitcoin might be the largest such network, but its success has given rise to a new generation of digital currencies, each with its own vision for the future of money.",1
"opencoin is larsen’s third technology start-up, but each business has changed how we think of money and what can be done with it. e-loan made credit scores free and available to customers while prosper created an online infrastructure for making personal loans outside of the banking system. “all three companies share a common dna—to eliminate needless waste and middlemen in the financial process,” larsen explained.",1
"ripple exists in two parts: the xrp, a mathematically regulated currency unit similar to bitcoin, and a payment system. users have “wallets” on the ripple system that they can add value to in any currency by means of an online exchange backed by a bank, like bitstamp (mt. gox doesn’t deal in xrp). once the wallet is full, that value can be transferred to any other user on the ripple network in any currency in seconds. bitcoin transactions, in comparison, can often take minutes to verify.",1
"when transferring money between currencies in today’s normal international banking system, the value has to move through several entities like banks and exchanges before it gets to the end user, and each middleman takes a cut of the value. ripple minimizes that process to one step, moving effortlessly between usd, yen, bitcoin, xrp, or even icelandic krona with just one exchange. the only charge is a tiny fraction of an xrp (currently worth slightly more than a penny), which guards against the kind of large-scale cyber attacks that have disrupted bitcoin.",1
"ripple’s potential is to make businesses like western union, which charges an average of 10.8 percent in money transfer fees, obsolete, giving a capital influx to countries that depend on worker remittances. it could also subsume bitcoin itself. on july 2, opencoin announced that ripple holders can send money to bitcoin users in any currency, and they will receive it in bitcoins. the move provides access to the bitcoin economy for the newer currency, and also creates a simple bridge between bitcoin and other non-digital currencies.",1
"like ripple, mintchip is a digital currency designed to make monetary exchanges smoother—but it’s run by a government rather than a private company. the royal canadian mint says that its new system is “better than cash,” but it’s actually a technology-enabled equivalent of the canadian dollar. like an official version of bitcoin, mintchip “operates without the need for personal identification, is instantaneous and does not have any age or credit requirements for use,” marc brule, the rcm’s chief financial officer, recently noted. “mintchip could be the digital equivalent of cash for online transactions.”",1
"each currency has its strengths and weaknesses. overseen by a government, mintchip certainly can’t match bitcoin’s anonymity or its utility for buying illegal goods. nor does ripple provide a “solution without an agenda,” mohan critiqued, because it’s controlled by a for-profit business rather than mathematics. some have even suggested that ripple’s owners are hoarding the currency. created by charles lee in 2011, litecoin is the frontrunner for a bitcoin successor that remains wholly independent.",1
"“we wanted to make a coin that is silver to bitcoin's gold,” lee explained in his post launching the currency. in order to discover new bitcoins, users must “mine” them with high-end computer equipment by solving complex equations. litecoins, currently worth around $2.80 each, are easily mined by any normal computer set-up, and the currency has more coins in circulation than bitcoin, with an 84 million cap versus bitcoin’s 21 million. this accessibility, along with its increased transaction speeds and better encryption, means that litecoin might have an easier time of being adopted by more mainstream users.",1
"these examples are just the most prominent in a sea of obscure cryptocurrencies. there’s dym, a ripple-based currency that uses pre-1965 u.s. silver dimes for backing, and feathercoin, which mohan described as the “copper to litecoin’s silver.” freicoin augments bitcoin with a charge that mounts the more time you don’t spend currency, the reverse of gaining interest from savings.",1
"despite roadblocks and competition, there’s also a chance that bitcoin is simply the best in the field. every currency depends on its users’ trust for legitimacy, and bitcoin still has the largest fan base by a long shot.",1
"no matter what denomination they come in, now that cryptocurrencies have broken into the mainstream, they’re not going back. what remains to be seen is which currency will emerge victorious: bitcoin, ripple, or a future, government-controlled digital payment structure. the competition could be a good thing. “technology has revolutionized communication, health care, and dozens of other industries ... but our underlying financial infrastructure has hardly changed,” opencoin’s chris larsen argued. “we are finally evolving.”",0

"cryptocurrency is a type of currency which uses digital files as money. usually, the files are created using the same ways as cryptography (the science of hiding information). digital signatures can be used to keep the transactions safe, and to let other people check that the transactions are real.[1][2][3] the first cryptocurrencies were made to be free of government-given currencies.",1
"cryptocurrencies are usually not controlled by any one person, but instead they are decentralized and controlled by many people.[4] this is different to 'centralized' electronic money and central banks which are controlled by a small amount of people.[5] the control of each cryptocurrency works through a distributed ledger (a list of transactions shared by everyone), usually a blockchain.[6] this lets everyone know all of the financial transactions that have taken place.[7]",1
"the term crypto mining means gaining cryptocurrencies by solving cryptographic equations through the use of computers. this process involves validating data blocks and adding transaction records to a public record (ledger) known as a blockchain.[17] this verifies transactions that were recently added. on top of maintaining the blockchain’s integrity, verification also prevents double-spending.",1

"the value of cryptocurrency is also driven by scarcity. this alludes to the cryptocurrency’s finite mechanism. the bitcoin protocol sets the maximum amount of btc that can be mined at 21 million. therefore, as more people enter the crypto space, bitcoin’s scarcity will inevitably increase, causing its price to increase. some coins also use the burning mechanism to increase their value by destroying a portion of the supply.",1

"stablecoins peg their values to various fiat currencies or assets, such as gold. most often pegged one-to-one with the u.s. dollar, stablecoins give users a way to sell into an asset carrying the same value as a national currency, but one that can still be transacted and stored in a crypto-esque fashion within the ecosystem.",1
"nonfungible tokens, or nfts, are yet another type of cryptocurrency, denoting that it is a one-of-a-kind asset and cannot be replaced. a bitcoin, for example, is fungible, meaning you can exchange one for another and get precisely the identical thing. however, a one-of-a-kind trade card, on the other hand, cannot be duplicated. you’d get something altogether different if you swapped it for a different card.",1
"since crypto is a relatively new industry compared with others, legal clarity does not yet exist in terms of requirements for all areas of the space. part of such clarity includes asset classification. bitcoin and ether are viewed as commodities, although categorization for numerous other assets remains unclear.",1
"a cryptocurrency transaction is usually a rapid and straightforward process. bitcoin, for example, can be exchanged between digital wallets using only a smartphone or computer. public and private keys and various incentive schemes such as proof-of-work and proof-of-stake are used to safeguard these transfers. payments in cryptocurrencies are growing more popular among large corporations and in industries such as fashion and pharmaceuticals.",1
"however, you’ll likely misplace your virtual wallet or lose your coins. there have also been thefts from the websites that exist to store cryptocurrency on the internet. because the value of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin can fluctuate dramatically, some people are hesitant to convert “real” money into bitcoin.",1

"cryptocurrency exchanges are vulnerable to cyber attacks that might result in your investment being lost forever — scams are always a possibility with cryptocurrency. scammers frequently use social media platforms such as instagram, facebook and twitter to dupe consumers into making these investments. if you believe you've been targeted, you should contact national reporting centers like action fraud in the united kingdom or the federal trade commission (ftc) in the united states as soon as possible.",1
"although blockchain appears to be sophisticated as it can be, its core notion is pretty simple. a database, or blockchain, is a sort of digital ledger. to comprehend the concept of blockchain, it is necessary to first understand what a database is. a database is a collection of data saved on a computer system in an electronic format.",0
"distributed ledger technology (dlt) is a decentralized database that various network participants administer. blockchain is a type of dlt where transactions are recorded using a hash, which is an immutable cryptographic signature. this means that if a single block in a chain is modified, it will be immediately clear that the chain has been tampered with. private and centralized blockchains, on the other hand, exist in which all of the computers that make up the network are owned and operated by a single company.",1
"popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum are built on blockchain technology. blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum are constantly growing as new blocks are added to the chain, increasing the security of the ledger dramatically.",1
decentralized platforms that require a coin can be enabled via blockchains. the blockchain is the distributed ledger technology that allows a network to maintain consensus. the network can track transactions and transfer value and information due to distributed consensus.,1
"as far as payment for assets goes, platforms offer crypto purchases via bank transfers, crypto transfers, or credit cards, depending on the platform. buying crypto with cash in a person-to-person fashion is also possible. availability for buying and selling crypto on any given platform, however, can vary from region to region.",1
"although cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are virtual currencies, they are treated as an asset for capital gains tax purposes, and “ordinary” investors who purchase bitcoin as an investment will experience a capital gain or loss when they exchange it for traditional currency, products, or services.",1
"cryptocurrency is a good investment if you want to gain direct exposure to the demand for digital currency, while a safer but potentially less lucrative alternative is to buy the stocks of companies with exposure to cryptocurrencies.",1
"while the success of any cryptocurrency initiative is not guaranteed, if it meets its objectives, early investors may be well rewarded in the long run. to be regarded as a long-term success, any cryptocurrency initiative must first achieve widespread adoption.",1
"cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have traditionally had little price correlation with the stock market in the united states, so owning some can help diversify your portfolio. if you believe that cryptocurrency usage will grow in popularity over time, it's probably a good idea to invest in crypto as part of a balanced portfolio. make sure you have an investment thesis for each cryptocurrency you buy. this will help you understand why the currency will stand the test of time.",1
"a cryptocurrency blockchain is constructed on the foundation of transactions. a blockchain is a collection of linked data blocks that include essential information such as cryptographic hashes. the blocks that make up a blockchain are collections of data transactions added to the ledger's end. this adds a degree of transparency, allowing network participants to see their transactions added (chained) to the blockchain.",1
"once there are enough transactions in the block, more information is added such as the header data and hash from the previous block in the chain and a new hash for the current block.",0
"the network’s miners then check the hash to see if the unconfirmed block is valid. this is a time for celebration among crypto miners because the proof of work has finally been completed. from the user's perspective, this essentially implies that the sender's cryptocurrency transfer to the receiver has been confirmed and will be added to the blockchain as part of the block.",1
"you can do a number of things with cryptocurrencies, depending on which one you own. on the most basic level, the definition of a cryptocurrency asset is that it can be used to send value from one person to another or to pay for goods and services.",1
"if you are a merchant, you can also accept digital assets as payment directly or through a payment processor or service that is more convenient and adds capabilities. some services give the option to convert paid cryptocurrencies into cash automatically on the back end, while there are also some companies that offer crypto top-up debit cards that are indistinguishable from any other plastic card to pay for goods or services.",1
"additionally, you can mine cryptocurrencies. mining uses your computer or designated hardware to help run the networks that back crypto assets. running a function on your computer or hardware automatically and continuously after it’s set up, carries out the mining process and generates revenue, helping to validate the transactions that are carried out on the blockchain, depending on the computing power designated.",1
"people can also borrow crypto assets on various platforms and earn interest for loaning out assets. this niche of the cryptocurrency space is what is known as decentralized finance, or defi. based on the dlt, various platforms facilitate the lending and borrowing of crypto without requiring the user to submit to the control of a centralized entity. defi also includes other aspects as well such as decentralized exchanges, or dexs.",1
"to enhance the security of a blockchain, crypto assets are locked for a set period to earn more cryptocurrency. this process is called staking in cryptocurrency. proof-of-stake (pos) blockchains like ethereum, cosmos, and tezos allow cryptocurrency owners to stake their crypto via a ""staking pool,"" which is analogous to an interest-bearing savings account.",1
the cryptocurrency generates rewards while being staked because the blockchain uses it. many long-term cryptocurrency owners view defi staking as a means to earn passive income rather than letting them sit idle in their wallets.,1
"the entire monetary worth of all the coins that have been mined is known as the market cap or capitalization. to get a cryptocurrency's market capitalization, multiply the price of each token by the number of circulating coins. bitcoin and ethereum are large-cap cryptocurrencies with higher liquidity and a market cap of more than $10 billion. on the other hand, coins with a market cap under $1 billion are considered small-cap, and coins whose market cap lies between $1 billion and $10 billion are considered mid-cap.",1
"price is only one metric used to assess a cryptocurrency's worth; however, market capitalization helps investors evaluate the value of several cryptocurrencies and convey a complete picture. as a crucial number, it can show whether a cryptocurrency is safe to acquire compared to others and its growth potential.",1
"cryptocurrency has come a long way over the last decade, advancing at a lightspeed pace. value can be stored, transferred and spent in different ways through various assets and solutions, while defi has pioneered the way for new borrowing and lending avenues.",1
"ever received a paper token from your next-door paan shop in lieu of a small change, which he would accept the next time you visit him? imagine that token digitally, and that's your cryptocurrency. the big difference is, here there is no owner-issuer and it would, at least in theory, be accepted globally. cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual coin secured by cryptography, which makes it next to impossible to counterfeit. they have their own store values, and are designed to use as a medium of exchange for buying goods or services. cryptocurrencies are decentralised, meaning that no authority regulates them. they are built on the blockchain network technology, which ensures transparency and helps track every transaction. such currencies, theoretically, are immune to government interference or any kind of manipulation. because cryptocurrencies do not have an underlying economic base, they are inflation-proof. plus, the digital structure facilitates free portability across geographical borders, divisibility and transparency. however, they are often criticised for the possibility of misuse in illegal activities, exchange rate volatility and the vulnerability of the infrastructure underlying them.",1
"blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing the risk and cutting costs for all involved. unlike a typical digital database, blockchain stores data in blocks that are then chained together. as new data comes in, it is entered in a fresh block. once the block is filled with data, it is chained to the previous block, which then chains the data in a chronological order. blockchain’s most common use so far has been as a ledger for transactions. in the case of cryptocurrencies, blockchain is used in a decentralised way so that no single person or group has control over it and, instead, all users can retain control collectively. decentralised blockchains are immutable, which means data once entered is irreversible. in the case of cryptocurrencies, this means transactions are recorded permanently and can be viewed by anyone.",1
"it’s not a very difficult task to invest in cryptocurrency, thanks to the easy access available to crypto exchanges and deep penetration of the internet and smartphones. technology has eased the access to digital currencies for potential investors. to invest in cryptocurrencies, investors need to first do some homework for choosing the right cryptocurrency and crypto exchange. one can buy these currencies using their home currencies, or us dollars, from his/her preferred exchange. however, there are some currencies that accept investment only in bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies.",1
"it is pretty easy actually. the entire process involves five key steps. they are: a) choose a crypto exchange; b) create your account and verify it; c) deposit the fund and start investing; d) place you order to buy desired cryptocurrency, e) select a storage method. however, there are also other ways to invest in cryptocurrencies. these include crypto etfs (similar to those of gold and other etfs) or investing in cryptocurrency-related stocks. these options are not so mainstream yet.",1
"there is no defined limit to invest in cryptocurrencies, just like there is no minimum limit to invest in stocks. however, there is some difference. if you do not wish to buy an entire cryptocurrency, you are allowed to buy small units of it. once registered, a user can add money to his/her wallet and use that amount to place an order for",1
"yes, you can invest in cryptocurrencies using indian currency, but you cannot use cash for the payment. every investor needs a bank account linked to the crypto account to add money and make a digital payment. only kyc-approved users can make such payments. investors should note that exchanges charge some fees when you make an investment and redeem it. the fee levied may vary from one exchange to another, and from one currency to another.",1
"yes, cryptocurrencies are a medium of exchange, which can be used to make payments for online purchases. there are hundreds of online shops and retailers that accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. however, there is a catch. both the buyer and seller should agree to accept the particular cryptocurrency for the deal. there are various search engines to find the goods and services that can be purchased using cryptocurrencies.",1
"if an investor believes in the technology-backed digital currency, then cryptocurrency should be his cup of tea. just a decade-old asset class, it has yielded astronomical returns over the years. some investors look to use these digitally coded tokens to hedge against inflation. despite high volatility and speculations, there are multiple reasons that they can become mainstream in the coming future.",1
"this question does not have a plain vanilla answer in ‘yes’ or ‘no’, as the government and the central bank still look unsure as to how to deal with this new-age phenomenon. in 2018, the reserve bank of india (rbi) came out strongly and kind of banned these tokens in india. then in 2020, the supreme court of india reversed the rbi ban. that move was welcomed by the crypto exchanges and investors throughout the country. after this, indian banks have tried to curtail transactions with crypto-exchanges as, in their view, they are governed by rbi. but later, rbi mentioned that banks cannot quote its 2018 ban to customers as it was overruled by the supreme court, paving the way for crypto trading to continue in india.",1

"before taking a closer look at some of these alternatives to bitcoin (btc), let’s step back and briefly examine what we mean by terms like cryptocurrency and altcoin. a cryptocurrency, broadly defined, is virtual or digital money that takes the form of tokens or “coins.” though some cryptocurrencies have ventured into the physical world with credit cards or other projects, the large majority remain entirely intangible.",1
"cryptocurrencies are almost always designed to be free from government manipulation and control—although, as they have grown more popular, this foundational aspect of the industry has come under fire. the cryptocurrencies modeled after bitcoin are collectively called altcoins, and in some cases, shitcoins, and have often tried to present themselves as modified or improved versions of bitcoin. though some of these currencies may have some impressive features that bitcoin does not, matching the level of security that bitcoin’s networks achieve largely has yet to be seen by an altcoin.",1
"cryptocurrencies are intended for payments, transmitting value (akin to digital money) across a decentralized network of users. many altcoins (i.e., those that are not bitcoin or sometimes ethereum) are classified in this way and may sometimes be called value tokens.",1
"there are also blockchain-based tokens that are meant to serve a different purpose from that of money. one example could be a token issued as part of an initial coin offering (ico) that represents a stake in a blockchain or decentralized finance (defi) project. if the tokens are linked to the value of the company or project, they can be called security tokens (as in securities like stocks, not safety).",1
"today, while many crypto users understand and appreciate these differences, traders and lay investors may not notice the difference because all categories of tokens tend to trade on crypto exchanges in the same way.",1
"the applications on ethereum are run on ether, its platform-specific cryptographic token. ether (eth) is like a vehicle for moving around on the ethereum platform and is sought mostly by developers looking to develop and run applications inside ethereum, or now, by investors looking to make purchases of other digital currencies using ether.",1
"tether (usdt) was one of the first and most popular of a group of so-called stablecoins—cryptocurrencies that aim to peg their market value to a currency or other external reference point to reduce volatility. because most digital currencies, even major ones like bitcoin, have experienced frequent periods of dramatic volatility, tether and other stablecoins attempt to smooth out price fluctuations to attract users who may otherwise be cautious. tether’s price is tied directly to the price of the u.s. dollar. the system allows users to more easily make transfers from other cryptocurrencies back to u.s. dollars in a more timely manner than actually converting to normal currency.",1
"xrp is the native token for the xrp ledger, created as a payment system by ripple in 2012. the xrp ledger uses a consensus mechanism called the xrp ledger consensus protocol, which doesn't use proof-of-work or proof-of-stake for consensus and validation. instead, client applications sign and send transactions to the ledger servers. the servers then compare the transactions and conclude that the transactions are candidates for entry into the ledger.",1
"due to this rigorous process, cardano stands out among its pos peers and other prominent cryptocurrencies. cardano has also been dubbed an “ethereum killer” because its blockchain is said to be capable of more. that said, cardano is still in its early stages. though it has beaten ethereum to the pos consensus model, it still has a long way to go regarding defi applications.",1

"a block is a collection of transaction data on a cryptocurrency network. it basically states that person a sent this amount of the cryptocurrency to person b, person x received this much cryptocurrency from person y, and so on.",1
"new blocks cannot be added to the blockchain without a miner computing a valid solution to the block's puzzle. with every transaction, the blockchain grows longer and the amount of computing power required to add a new block increases. the blockchain, by design, becomes increasingly tamper-proof; a hacker today would need computing power equivalent to the majority of the computing power on the cryptocurrency network to successfully alter transactions.",1
"another method of establishing distributed consensus to add to a blockchain is known as proof of stake. instead of requiring vast amounts of computing power, the proof-of-stake method enables the cryptocurrency holders with the most wealth or the oldest stakes to create blocks by verifying transactions.",1
"bitcoin is by far the most valuable cryptocurrency. as the original cryptocurrency, it has the strongest adoption rate and a large network of miners. those factors ensure it remains at the top of this list.",1
"ethereum's ether is the second-largest cryptocurrency and consistently so. ethereum serves as a platform for other cryptocurrencies besides ether, and offering decentralized applications to other token creators ensures that ether consistently retains greater value than those other tokens. most cryptocurrencies rely on the decentralized applications provided by ethereum.",1

"cryptocurrency markets are decentralised, which means they are not issued or backed by a central authority such as a government. instead, they run across a network of computers. however, cryptocurrencies can be bought and sold via exchanges and stored in ‘wallets’ .",1
"unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies exist only as a shared digital record of ownership, stored on a blockchain. when a user wants to send cryptocurrency units to another user, they send it to that user’s digital wallet. the transaction isn’t considered final until it has been verified and added to the blockchain through a process called mining. this is also how new cryptocurrency tokens are usually created.",1
"a blockchain is a shared digital register of recorded data. for cryptocurrencies, this is the transaction history for every unit of the cryptocurrency, which shows how ownership has changed over time. blockchain works by recording transactions in ‘blocks’, with new blocks added at the front of the chain.",1
"a blockchain file is always stored on multiple computers across a network – rather than in a single location – and is usually readable by everyone within the network. this makes it both transparent and very difficult to alter, with no one weak point vulnerable to hacks, or human or software error.",1
mining computers select pending transactions from a pool and check to ensure that the sender has sufficient funds to complete the transaction. this involves checking the transaction details against the transaction history stored in the blockchain. a second check confirms that the sender authorised the transfer of funds using their private key.,1

"the spread is the difference between the buy and sell prices quoted for a cryptocurrency. like many financial markets, when you open a position on a cryptocurrency market, you’ll be presented with two prices. if you want to open a long position, you trade at the buy price, which is slightly above the market price. if you want to open a short position, you trade at the sell price – slightly below the market price.",1
"cryptocurrencies are often traded in lots – batches of cryptocurrency tokens used to standardise the size of trades. as cryptocurrencies are very volatile, lots tend to be very small: most are just one unit of the base cryptocurrency. however, some cryptocurrencies are traded in bigger lots.",1
"margin is usually expressed as a percentage of the full position. a trade on bitcoin (btc), for instance, might require 10% of the total value of the position to be paid for it to be opened. so instead of depositing $5000, you’d only need to deposit $500.",1
"pips are the units used to measure movement in the price of a cryptocurrency, and refer to a one-digit movement in the price at a specific level. generally, valuable cryptocurrencies are traded at the ‘dollar´ level, so a move from a price of $190.00 to $191.00, for example, would mean that the cryptocurrency has moved a single pip. however, some lower-value cryptocurrencies are traded at different scales, where a pip can be a cent or even a fraction of a cent.",1

"the difference between a digital currency and a cryptocurrency is that the latter is decentralised, meaning it is not issued or backed by a central authority such as a central bank or government. instead, cryptocurrencies run across a network of computers. digital currencies have all the characteristics of traditional currencies but exist only in the digital world. they are issued by a central authority.",1

"the first cryptocurrency was bitcoin. the bitcoin domain was registered in 2008, but the first transaction took place in 2009. it was developed by someone called ‘satoshi nakamoto’. however, there is speculation that nakamoto is a pseudonym as the bitcoin creator is notoriously secretive, and no one knows whether ‘he’ is a person or a group.",1
"cryptocurrencies are an alternative to traditional money. today, some outlets accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. however, they bear little resemblance to other asset classes because they are intangible and extremely volatile. they are mainly used by traders for speculating on rises and falls in value.",1

"individual units of cryptocurrencies can be referred to as coins or tokens, depending on how they are used. some are intended to be units of exchange for goods and services, others are stores of value, and some can be used to participate in specific software programs such as games and financial products.",1
"one common way cryptocurrencies are created is through a process known as mining, which is used by bitcoin. bitcoin mining can be an energy-intensive process in which computers solve complex puzzles in order to verify the authenticity of transactions on the network. as a reward, the owners of those computers can receive newly created cryptocurrency. other cryptocurrencies use different methods to create and distribute tokens, and many have a significantly lighter environmental impact.",1
"it’s important to remember that bitcoin is different from cryptocurrency in general. while bitcoin is the first and most valuable cryptocurrency, the market is large.",1
"more than 21,000 different cryptocurrencies are traded publicly, according to coinmarketcap.com, a market research website. and cryptocurrencies continue to proliferate. the total value of all cryptocurrencies on sept. 30, 2022 was about $950 million, having fallen substantially from an all-time high above $2.9 trillion late in 2021.",1

"cryptocurrency inspires passionate opinions across the spectrum of investors. here are a few reasons that some people believe it is a transformational technology, while others worry it's a fad.",1
"supporters see cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as the currency of the future and are racing to buy them now, presumably before they become more valuable.",1
some supporters like the fact that cryptocurrency removes central banks from managing the money supply since over time these banks tend to reduce the value of money via inflation.,1
"in communities in that have been underserved by the traditional financial system, some people see cryptocurrencies as a promising foothold. pew research center data from 2021 found that asian, black and hispanic people ""are more likely than white adults to say they have ever invested in, traded or used a cryptocurrency.""",1
"other advocates like the blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies, because it’s a decentralized processing and recording system and can be more secure than traditional payment systems.",1

"involves using your cryptocurrencies to help verify transactions on a blockchain protocol. though staking has its risks, it can allow you to grow your crypto holdings without buying more.",1
"many cryptocurrency projects are untested, and blockchain technology in general has yet to gain wide adoption. if the underlying idea behind cryptocurrency does not reach its potential, long-term investors may never see the returns they hoped for.",1
"those wild shifts in value may also cut against the basic ideas behind the projects that cryptocurrencies were created to support. for example, people may be less likely to use bitcoin as a payment system if they are not sure what it will be worth the next day.",1
"the environmental impact of bitcoin and other projects that use similar mining protocols is significant. a comparison by the university of cambridge, for instance, said worldwide bitcoin mining consumes more than twice as much power as all u.s. residential lighting",1
"governments around the world have not yet fully reckoned with how to handle cryptocurrency, so regulatory changes and crackdowns have the potential to affect the market in unpredictable ways.",1
"cryptocurrency is a relatively risky investment, no matter which way you slice it. generally speaking, high-risk investments should make up a small part of your overall portfolio — one common guideline is no more than 10%. you may want to look first to shore up your retirement savings, pay off debt or invest in less-volatile funds made up of stocks and bonds.",1
"perhaps the most important thing when investing in anything is to do your homework. this is particularly important when it comes to cryptocurrencies, which are often linked to a specific technological product that is being developed or rolled out. when you buy a stock, it is linked to a company that is subject to well-defined financial reporting requirements, which can give you a sense of its prospects.",1
"cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are more loosely regulated in the u.s., so discerning which projects are viable can be even more challenging. if you have a financial advisor who is familiar with cryptocurrency, it may be worth asking for input.",1
"for beginning investors, it can also be worthwhile to examine how widely a cryptocurrency is being used. most reputable crypto projects have publicly available metrics showing data such as how many transactions are being carried out on their platforms. if use of a cryptocurrency is growing, that may be a sign that it is establishing itself in the market. cryptocurrencies also generally make ""white papers"" available to explain how they'll work and how they intend to distribute tokens.",1

"it can take a lot of work to comb through a prospectus; the more detail it has, the better your chances it’s legitimate. but even legitimacy doesn’t mean the currency will succeed. that’s an entirely separate question, and that requires a lot of market savvy. be sure to consider how to protect yourself from fraudsters who see cryptocurrencies as an opportunity to bilk investors.",1
"there’s no question that cryptocurrencies are legal in the u.s., though china has essentially banned their use, and ultimately whether they’re legal depends on each individual country.",1
"the question of whether cryptocurrencies are legally allowed, however, is only one part of the legal question. other things to consider include how crypto is taxed and what you can buy with cryptocurrency.",1
"you might call them cryptocurrencies, but they differ from traditional currencies in one important way: there's no requirement in most places that they be accepted as ""legal tender."" the u.s. dollar, by contrast, must be accepted for ""all debts, public and private."" countries around the world are taking various approaches to cryptocurrency. el salvador in 2021 became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. meanwhile, china is developing its own digital currency",1
", a networking protocol through which computers can work together to keep a shared, tamper-proof record of transactions. the challenge in a blockchain network is in making sure that all participants can agree on the correct copy of the historical ledger. without a recognized way to validate transactions, it would be difficult for people to trust that their holdings are secure. there are several ways of reaching ""consensus"" on a blockchain network, but the two that are most widely used are known as ""proof of work"" and ""proof of stake.”",0
"is one way of incentivizing users to help maintain an accurate historical record of who owns what on a blockchain network. bitcoin uses proof of work, which makes this method an important part of the crypto conversation. blockchains rely on users to collate and submit blocks of recent transactions for inclusion in the ledger, and bitcoin's protocol rewards them for doing so successfully. this process is known as mining.",1
"there is stiff competition for these rewards, so many users try to submit blocks, but only one can be selected for each new block of transactions. to decide who gets the reward, bitcoin requires users to solve a difficult puzzle, which uses a huge amount of energy and computing power. the completion of this puzzle is the ""work"" in proof of work.",1
"for lucky miners, the bitcoin rewards are more than enough to offset the costs involved. but the huge upfront cost is also a way to discourage dishonest players. if you win the right to create a block, it might not be worth the risk of tampering with the records and having your submission thrown out — forfeiting the reward. in this instance, spending the money on energy costs in an attempt to tamper with the historical record would have resulted in significant loss.",1
"is another way of achieving consensus about the accuracy of the historical record of transactions on a blockchain. it eschews mining in favor of a process known as staking, in which people put some of their own cryptocurrency holdings at stake to vouch for the accuracy of their work in validating new transactions. some of the cryptocurrencies that use proof of stake include cardano, solana and ethereum (which is in the process of converting from proof of work).",1
"proof of stake systems have some similarities to proof of work protocols, in that they rely on users to collect and submit new transactions. but they have a different way of incentivizing honest behavior among those who participate in that process. essentially, people who propose new blocks of information to be added to the record must put some cryptocurrency at stake. in many cases, your chances of landing a new block (and the associated rewards) go up as you put more at stake. people who submit inaccurate data can lose some of the money they've put at risk.",1
"mining cryptocurrency is generally only possible for a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency such as bitcoin. and before you get too far, it is worth noting that the barriers to entry can be high and the probability of success relatively low without major investment.",1
"while early bitcoin users were able to mine the cryptocurrency using regular computers, the task has gotten more difficult as the network has grown. now, most miners use special computers whose sole job is to run the complex calculations involved in mining all day every day. and even one of these computers isn't going to guarantee you success. many miners use entire warehouses full of mining equipment in their quest to collect rewards.",1
"if you don’t have the resources to compete with the heavy hitters, one option is joining a mining pool, where users share rewards. this reduces the size of the reward you'd get for a successful block, but increases the chance that you could at least get some return on your investment.",0
"just like with buying cryptocurrencies, there are several options for converting your crypto holdings into cash. while decentralized exchanges and peer-to-peer transactions may be right for some investors, many choose to use centralized services to offload their holdings.",1
"with a centralized exchange, the process is basically the reverse of buying. but one advantage if you own crypto is that you probably already have everything set up. here are the steps:",1
"connect the wallet that holds the cryptocurrencies that you want to sell, and make sure the exchange you’ve chosen supports both that wallet and the asset in question.",1

"cryptocurrency is stored in a digital wallet, which can be online, on your computer, or on an external hard drive. a digital wallet has a wallet address, which is usually a long string of numbers and letters. if something happens to your wallet or your cryptocurrency funds — like your online exchange platform goes out of business, you send cryptocurrency to the wrong person, you lose the password to your digital wallet, or your digital wallet is stolen or compromised — you’re likely to find that no one can step in to help you recover your funds.",1

"the value of a cryptocurrency can change rapidly, even changing by the hour. and the amount of the change can be significant. it depends on many factors, including supply and demand. cryptocurrencies tend to be more volatile than more traditional investments, such as stocks and bonds. an investment that’s worth thousands of dollars today might be worth only hundreds tomorrow. and, if the value goes down, there’s no guarantee it will go up again.",1
"once you pay with cryptocurrency, you can usually only get your money back if the person you paid sends it back. before you buy something with cryptocurrency, know the seller’s reputation, by doing some research before you pay.",1
"people talk about cryptocurrency transactions as anonymous. but the truth is not that simple. cryptocurrency transactions will typically be recorded on a public ledger, called a “blockchain.” that’s a public list of every cryptocurrency transaction — both on the payment and receipt sides. depending on the blockchain, the information added to the blockchain can include details like the transaction amount, as well as the sender’s and recipient’s wallet addresses. it’s sometimes possible to use transaction and wallet information to identify the people involved in a specific transaction. and when you buy something from a seller who collects other information about you, like a shipping address, that information can also be used to identify you later on.",1

"investment scams often promise you can ""make lots of money"" with ""zero risk,"" and often start on social media or online dating apps or sites. these scams can, of course, start with an unexpected text, email, or call, too.",1
"they promise to grow your money — but only if you buy cryptocurrency and transfer it into their online account. the investment website they steer you to looks real, but it’s really fake, and so are their promises. if you log in to your “investment account,” you won’t be able to withdraw your money at all, or only if you pay high fees.",1

"activity in cryptocurrency markets has increased  									significantly. the fascination with these currencies  									appears to have been more speculative (buying  									cryptocurrencies to make a profit) than related to  									their use as a new and unique system for making  									payments. related to this, there has also been  									a high degree of volatility in the prices of many  									cryptocurrencies. for example, the price of bitcoin  									increased from about us$30,000 in mid 2021 to  									almost us$70,000 toward the end of 2021 before  									falling to around us$35,000 in early 2022. rival  									cryptocurrencies like ether have experienced  									similar volatility. the extraordinary interest in  									cryptocurrencies has also seen a growing amount  									of computing power used to solve the complex  									codes that many of these systems use to help  									protect them from being corrupted. despite the  									increased level of interest in cryptocurrencies, there  									is scepticism about whether they could ever replace  									more traditional payment methods or national  									currencies.",1

"a frequently asked question is whether  									cryptocurrency can be defined as ‘money’. the  									short answer is that cryptocurrency is not a form  									of money. to understand why, we can ask whether  									the characteristics of cryptocurrencies match the  									key characteristics of money:",1
"so, while cryptocurrencies can be used to make  									payments, currently their use as a means of  									payment is limited and they do not display the key  									characteristics of money.",1
"however, there is one type of digital currency that  									could be considered money – digital currency  									issued by a central bank.",1
"a central bank digital currency (cbdc) can most  									easily be understood as a digital form of cash. it  									can be issued by the central bank, accessible to  									the general public, and used to settle transactions  									between firms and households. the unit of  									account would be the national currency, and it  									could be exchanged at parity (i.e. one for one) with  									other forms of money, such as physical currency  									or electronic deposits with well-regulated financial  									institutions.",1
"what are the main differences between  									cryptocurrencies and cbdcs? in other words, what  									makes a cbdc money? a central bank has the  									ability to ensure that a digital currency it issues  									exhibits the three main features of money – that  									is, a cbdc could function as a widely accepted  									means of payment, store of value and unit of  									account.",1
"because it is issued by a central bank, a cbdc  									would have legal tender status, making it widely  									accepted as a means of payment. a cbdc would  									also be an equivalent store of value to other forms  									of money, since it could be exchanged for an  									equal value of physical cash or electronic deposits.  									finally, the unit of account for cbdc issued by the  									reserve bank would be the australian dollar. this  									means it could be used to measure the value of  									goods and service. these and other key features  									have been summarised in the table below.",1

"the most well known cryptocurrency is bitcoin. bitcoin was launched in 2009, a year after a  										report that described the bitcoin system was released under the name satoshi nakamoto. the  										system was designed to electronically mimic features of a cash transaction. it was designed to  										allow peer-to-peer (or person-to-person) transactions, without the need to know or trust the  										other person in the transaction, and to occur without the need for a central party (such as a  										bank). unlike conventional national currencies such as australian dollars, which get part of their  										value from being legislated as legal tender, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies do not have  										any legislated or intrinsic value. instead, the value of bitcoin is determined by what people are  										willing to pay for it in the market (and, in theory, its value could fall to zero at any time).",1
"one feature of the bitcoin system is that the supply of bitcoins increases at a pre-determined  										rate and is capped at around 21 million (with each bitcoin able to be subdivided into 100  										million satoshis or 0.00000001 bitcoins). because of this, the supply of bitcoins has been  										commonly compared to the supply of a scarce commodity, such as gold.",1
"the bitcoin system allows transactions to occur directly from person to person without  										requiring a central party (such as a bank) to verify or record the transactions. this is unlike most  										conventional payment methods, such as electronic bank transfers, which rely on a central party  										to keep and update records of transactions. for example, commercial banks maintain a record  										of their customers' account balances, deposits and withdrawals.",1
"instead, the bitcoin system uses ‘blockchain’ technology to record transactions and the  										ownership of bitcoins. this is essentially technology that connects groups of transactions  										(‘blocks’) together over time (in a ‘chain’). each time a transaction occurs, it forms part of a new  										block that is added to the chain. as a result, the blockchain provides a record (or database) of  										every bitcoin transaction that has ever occurred, and it is available for anyone to access and  										update on a public network (this is often referred to as a ‘distributed ledger’). the integrity of  										the bitcoin system is protected by ‘cryptography’, which is a method of verifying and securing  										data using complex mathematical algorithms (or codes). this makes the system very difficult to  										corrupt.",1
"bitcoin transactions are verified by other users of the network, and the process of compiling,  										verifying and confirming transactions is often referred to as ‘mining’. in particular, complex  										codes need to be solved to confirm transactions and make sure the system is not corrupted.  										the bitcoin system increases the complexity of these codes as more computing power is  										used to solve them. a new block of transactions is compiled approximately every ten minutes.  										‘miners’ want to solve the codes and process transactions because they are rewarded with new  										bitcoins (currently 6.25 new bitcoins per block).",1
"the increase in competition between miners for new bitcoins has seen large increases in the  										amount of computing power and electricity required (which is often used for air conditioning  										to cool computer systems). while it is difficult to calculate with precision, some estimates  										suggest that the annual energy consumption of the bitcoin system is roughly equal to the  										country of thailand.",1

one of the most exciting things about bitcoin technology is its potential to support applications other than currency. we'll study several of these and study the properties of bitcoin that makes this possible.,0
"hundreds of altcoins, or alternative cryptocurrencies, have been started, either to fix bitcoin's perceived flaws or to pursue different goals and properties. we'll look at everything that goes into an altcoin and how they interact with bitcoin.",1
"the use of bitcoin technology for decentralizing property, markets, and so on has been hailed as a recipe for economic and political disruption. we'll look at the technological underpinnings of these proposals and the potential impact on society.",1
"the theory part is quite good: you get a rather strong in-detail understanding of the technology behind bitcoin. the java programming assignments, however, are an organizational disaster.",0
"interesting course. good points: material is interesting and comprehensive, lecturers are knowledgeable. not so good points: assignment specifications and test code is poor (or non-existent).",0
"access to lectures and assignments depends on your type of enrollment. if you take a course in audit mode, you will be able to see most course materials for free. to access graded assignments and to earn a certificate, you will need to purchase the certificate experience, during or after your audit. if you don't see the audit option:",0
"the course may offer 'full course, no certificate' instead. this option lets you see all course materials, submit required assessments, and get a final grade. this also means that you will not be able to purchase a certificate experience.",0
"crypto-assets (crypto) also known as cryptocurrencies, coins or tokens are digital assets that do not have a physical form. they may not be backed by physical assets.",1
"crypto-assets (crypto) also known as cryptocurrency, virtual or digital assets, is an emerging type of asset class. it does not exist physically as coins or notes, but as digital tokens stored in a digital “wallet”. these digital tokens rely on cryptography and technology such as blockchain for security and other features. crypto may or may not have an actual asset underlying it.",1
this means that the price of crypto-assets can fluctuate at extreme levels based solely on market speculation. factors that can influence the price of crypto include:,1
"crypto-assets were first developed as a digital form of currency, to be used as money. some stores accept crypto as payment for goods and services, and some atms let you withdraw it as physical money. however, crypto is not legal tender in australia and is not widely accepted as payment.",1
a user’s wallet has a set of private keys (unique codes) that are used to authorise outgoing transactions on the blockchain network. a wallet may be a software (hot) or hardware (cold) wallet. a hardware wallet stores these private keys on a secure hardware device not connected to the internet. this can protect the user’s wallet from hackers.,1
"some of the most common types are listed below, but this does not cover all of them. new cryptos are being created all the time, although many are not well structured and do not last.",1
how it works: ‘bitcoin miners’ use computer-intensive software to validate transactions that pass through the bitcoin network. they earn new bitcoins in the process.,1
the bitcoin network is a decentralised global ‘payment’ system that records transactions in a blockchain. bitcoins are bought and sold in large volumes as a speculative investment.,1
"how it works: ethereum can process transactions, contracts and run other programs. so developers can create and run any program, in any programming language, on a single decentralised platform.",1
what it is: litecoin is the name of a network and crypto-asset that was adapted from bitcoin’s open-source code and modified. it is based on a global ‘payment’ network.,1
how it works: the litecoin network processes transactions faster than the bitcoin network. there are also more litecoins in circulation than there are bitcoins.,1
what it is: xrp is the native crypto-asset used for products developed by ripple. ripple is a network that allows real-time transfers between users in any currency or crypto-assets.,1
"how it works: ripple is a database in which users can store and transfer value in any currency on a protected network. ripple uses crypto-assets created by others, rather than those mined or earned like on the bitcoin or ethereum network.",1
"many crypto-assets and other digital assets are commonly not considered to be financial products. because of this, the platforms where you buy and sell crypto may not be regulated by asic. this means you may not be protected if the platform fails or is hacked.",1
"when a cryptocurrency fails, investors will most likely lose all the money they put in. in most countries, cryptocurrencies are not recognised as legal tender. you're only protected to the extent that they fit within existing laws.",1
"investing in crypto-assets is highly speculative. the market value can fluctuate a lot over short periods of time, and is affected by things like media hype and investor opinion.",1
"your digital wallet has a public key and a private key (like a password or pin). however, crypto-asset systems allow users to remain relatively anonymous and there is no central data bank. if a hacker steals your crypto-asset, you have little hope of getting it back.",1
"unlike traditional financial products, there is usually no product disclosure statement or prospectus that explains in plain english, and in one place, how the crypto-asset operates.",1
the processes for interacting directly with crypto-asset networks is also unfamiliar to many people. they may require special-purpose software and an understanding of how transaction fees operate. unfamiliar users run the risk of:,1

"crypto market cap is the total value of all the coins of a particular cryptocurrency that have been mined or are in circulation. market capitalization is used to determine the ranking of cryptocurrencies. the higher the market cap of a particular crypto coin, the higher its ranking and share of the market. crypto market cap is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins in circulation by its current price. for instance, to calculate the market cap of ethereum, all you need to do is multiply the total number of ethereum in circulation by the current price of one ethereum and you will get its market cap.",1
"the price is calculated using a global volume-weighted average price formula which is based on the pairings available on different exchanges of a particular crypto asset. for examples and more detailed information on how we track cryptocurrency prices and other metrics, see our methodology page here.",1
"you may notice that cryptocurrencies listed on different exchanges have different prices. the reasons for this are complex, but simply put cryptocurrencies are traded on different exchanges and across different markets with varying economic conditions, liquidity, trading pairs, and offerings (e.g. derivatives / leverage) which all influence price in their own way.",1
"you can track over 10,000 crypto prices on coingecko across more than 50 currencies. popular cryptocurrency pairs include btc to usd, eth to usd, and slp to php. you can also track metrics such as 24 hour trading volume, market capitalization, price chart, historical performance chart, the circulating supply, and more. sign up to use coingecko’s crypto portfolio to track the performance of your portfolio. you may also check out geckoterminal (currently in beta), our comprehensive multichain on-chain charting tool featuring live charts, current trades, market sentiment and more as it happens in real time! coingecko also has a mobile app that enables you to track cryptocurrencies on android and ios.",1
"the 24h trading volume refers to the amount a cryptocurrency has been bought and sold on all exchanges within the last 24 hours on the spot market (see derivatives volume here). for instance, if the 24h volume for ethereum is $15 billion, it means that $15 billion worth of ether had changed hands across all exchanges in the last 24 hours.",1

"blockchain tech is actually rather easy to understand at its core. essentially, it's a shared database populated with entries that must be confirmed and encrypted. think of it as a kind of highly encrypted and verified shared google document, in which each entry in the sheet depends on a logical relationship to all its predecessors. blockchain tech offers a way to securely and efficiently create a tamper-proof log of sensitive activity (anything from international money transfers to shareholder records).",1
"blockchain's conceptual framework and underlying code is useful for a variety of financial processes because of the potential it has to give companies a secure, digital alternative to banking processes that are typically bureaucratic, time-consuming, paper-heavy, and expensive.",1
"cryptocurrencies are essentially just digital money, digital tools of exchange that use cryptography and the aforementioned blockchain technology to facilitate secure and anonymous transactions. there had been several iterations of cryptocurrency over the years, but bitcoin truly thrust cryptocurrencies forward in the late 2000s. there are thousands of cryptocurrencies floating out on the market now, but bitcoin is far and away the most popular.",1
"bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies don't just fall out of the sky. like any other form of money, it takes work to produce them. and that work comes in the form of mining.",1
"but let's take a step back. satoshi nakamoto, the founder of bitcoin, ensured that there would ever only be 21 million bitcoins in existence. he (or they) reached that figure by calculating that people would discover, or ""mine,"" a certain number of blocks of transactions each day.",1
"as for mining bitcoins, the process requires electrical energy. miners solve complex mathematical problems, and the reward is more bitcoins generated and awarded to them. miners also verify transactions and prevent fraud, so more miners equals faster, more reliable, and more secure transactions.",1
"thanks to satoshi nakamoto's designs, bitcoin mining becomes more difficult as more miners join the fray. in 2009, a miner could mine 200 bitcoin in a matter of days. in 2014, it would take approximately 98 years to mine just one, according to 99bitcoins.",1
"super powerful computers called application specific integrated circuit, or asic, were developed specifically to mine bitcoins. but because so many miners have joined in the last few years, it remains difficult to mine loads. the solution is mining pools, groups of miners who band together and are paid relative to their share of the work.",1
"since its inception, bitcoin has been rather volatile. but based on its recent boom — and a forecast by snapchat's first investor, jeremy liew, that it would hit $500,000 by 2030 — and the prospect of grabbing a slice of the bitcoin pie becomes far more attractive.",1
"bitcoin users expect 94% of all bitcoins to be released by 2024. as the number moves toward the ceiling of 21 million, many expect the profits miners once made from the creation of new blocks to become so low that they will become negligible. but as more bitcoins enter circulation, transaction fees could rise and offset this.",1
"as for blockchain technology itself, it has numerous applications, from banking to the internet of things. it is expected that companies will flesh out their blockchain iot solutions. blockchain is a promising tool that will transform parts of the iot and enable solutions that provide greater insight into assets, operations, and supply chains. it will also transform how health records and connected medical devices store and transmit data.",0
"blockchain won’t be usable everywhere, but in many cases, it will be a part of the solution that makes the best use of the tools in the iot arsenal. blockchain can help to address particular problems, improve workflows, and reduce costs, which are the ultimate goals of any iot project.",0
"for virtually all of 2022, cryptocurrencies as an asset class have been a sort of high-beta version of the stock market: when stocks go up, crypto goes up more and vice versa. unfortunately, stocks haven't gone up: by the end of september, the s&p 500, the dow jones industrial average and the nasdaq had all entered bear markets. at the start of the fourth quarter, the s&p 500 was down 24.8% in 2022, while the tech-heavy nasdaq was off 32.4%. crypto had dropped an astounding 56.6% over that period. the good news is that in september, when the stock market shed 9.3%, digital assets showed signs of resilience, losing just 3.1%. the history of crypto price fluctuations is rife with incredible volatility, and more interest rate hikes are almost guaranteed. but for risk-tolerant contrarians, october could be a good moment to take a position in crypto. here are seven of the best cryptocurrencies to buy.",1
"the only other coin in bitcoin's stratosphere is ether, the native token of the wildly popular ethereum blockchain. a favorite of users and developers alike, ethereum's ecosystem quickly emerged as an early haven for decentralized finance, or defi, applications. unlike the bitcoin network, ethereum offers real-world utility outside of payments, with the issuance of smart contracts and non-fungible tokens launching multibillion-dollar industries practically overnight. in popular culture, one of the biggest knocks against crypto at large is its energy inefficiency. ethereum confronted that head-on in september when it completed a long-awaited event called ""the merge"" that transitioned it from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus, reducing expected energy consumption by more than 99%. with a market cap of more than $160 billion, the next-largest non-stablecoin in existence is less than a third of eth's size.",1
"avax is the native currency of the avalanche blockchain, which claims to be the fastest smart-contracts platform in the world. avalanche's goal for its platform is to become something like the aws of crypto. aws, short for amazon web services, is a division of amazon.com inc. (ticker: amzn) and is the largest cloud computing company in the world. many financial institutions and massive global organizations use aws to power their online operations. avalanche aims to do the same for blockchains, seeing a future where every commercial entity will want to launch their own blockchain. avalanche is uniquely suited to foster such a future via a relatively new feature called subnets. although a $5 billion market cap is utterly unremarkable in the stock market, it makes avalanche a top-20 cryptocurrency. avax trades around $17 with a 52-week trading range of $13.79 to $146.22.",1
"excluding stablecoins, binance coin is the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap – behind only bitcoin and ether – valued at about $48 billion. as the largest global crypto exchange, binance is uniquely positioned to benefit from crypto's steady growth in popularity over time. binance's own thriving ecosystem uses bnb coin as the core underlying currency of its blockchain. as of oct. 5, trailing 24-hour volume on binance was $14.7 billion, dwarfing the next-largest mainstream competitor, coinbase global inc. (coin), with a volume of $1.5 billion. unlike the money supply of traditional currencies, which tends to ceaselessly grow over time, bnb actually takes a portion of transaction fees and ""burns"" them on a quarterly basis, reducing supply and increasing scarcity. trading around $290, bnb has a 52-week trading range between $184.54 and $669.35.",1
"atom is the native token of the cosmos hub blockchain. as a governance token, owning the coin also gives its holders a say in how the project should proceed. a top-25 cryptocurrency by market cap, atom has a trading history going back to 2017 – a solid track record in this young field. as one might be able to tell from this list alone, there are a lot of separate blockchains already in existence, and that fact gives cosmos' goal all the more relevance. cosmos aims to make blockchains more developer-friendly, and also hopes to directly enable more seamless communication between different blockchain networks. trading around the $13 level today, atom has a market cap of $3.8 billion and a 52-week trading range between $5.59 and $44.52.",1
"the last of the best cryptocurrencies to buy is filecoin, the smallest by market cap of any name on this list. that said, filecoin isn't brand-new by any means, with a track record going back to 2017. as with cosmos, filecoin is a bit more speculative than other names on this list, but its unique project ambition makes it worth a watch. filecoin is a decentralized storage network with the stated goal of storing the world's most important information, and its decentralized nature makes it uniquely suited for data someone might want to insulate from censorship. the system also makes data easy to retrieve, making it an ideal way to document alleged war crimes committed by russia in ukraine in real time, as stanford's starling lab is currently doing.",1

"as an early altcoin or bitcoin alternative, litecoin initially rose to prominence thanks to its use of the scrypt hashing algorithm, which was seen by advocates as being easier to manage than the sha-256 encryption used by bitcoin.",1
"using a public distributed ledger, monero gained a degree of unwanted notoriety in 2018 and 2019 as being the cryptocurrency of choice for cryptomining attacks. attackers attempted to deploy hidden monero miners on unsuspecting users' systems, as the cryptocurrency is easier to create via the mining process than bitcoin.",1

"in the early days of bitcoin, many hoped that the cryptocurrency could and would be used to buy everyday items, such as a pizza. in 2010, laszlo hanyecz bought $41 worth pizza from papa john's, for which he paid 10,000 bitcoin at the time. in 2021, that amount of bitcoin would have been worth over $380 million.",1

"cryptocurrency is a virtual currency secured through one-way cryptography. it appears on a distributed ledger called a blockchain that's transparent and shared among all users in a permanent and verifiable way that's nearly impossible to fake or hack into. the original intent of cryptocurrency was to allow online payments to be made directly from one party to another without the need for a central third-party intermediary like a bank. however, with the introduction of smart contracts, non-fungible tokens, stablecoins, and other innovations, additional uses and capabilities are rapidly evolving.",1
"cryptocurrency's value stems from a combination of scarcity and the perception that it is a store of value, an anonymous means of payment, or a hedge against inflation. cryptocurrency investors can buy or sell them directly in a spot market, or they can invest indirectly in a futures market or by using investment products that provide cryptocurrency exposure.",1

"after people realized the barter system didn’t work very well, the currency went through a few iterations: in 110 b.c., an official currency was minted; in a.d. 1250, gold-plated florins were introduced and used across europe; and from 1600 to 1900, the paper currency gained widespread popularity and ended up being used around the world. this is how modern currency as we know it came into existence.",1
"modern currency includes paper currency, coins, credit cards, and digital wallets—for example, apple pay, amazon pay, paytm, paypal, and so on. all of it is controlled by banks and governments, meaning that there is a centralized regulatory authority that limits how paper currency and credit cards work.",1
"imagine a scenario in which you want to repay a friend who bought you lunch, by sending money online to his or her account. there are several ways in which this could go wrong, including:",1
"this is why the future of currency lies with cryptocurrency. now imagine a similar transaction between two people using the bitcoin app. a notification appears asking whether the person is sure he or she is ready to transfer bitcoins. if yes, processing takes place: the system authenticates the user’s identity, checks whether the user has the required balance to make that transaction, and so on. after that’s done, the payment is transferred and the money lands in the receiver’s account. all of this happens in a matter of minutes.",1
"cryptocurrency, then, removes all the problems of modern banking: there are no limits to the funds you can transfer, your accounts cannot be hacked, and there is no central point of failure. as mentioned above, as of 2018 there are more than 1,600 cryptocurrencies available; some popular ones are bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, and zcash. and a new cryptocurrency crops up every single day. considering how much growth they’re experiencing at the moment, there’s a good chance that there are plenty more to come!",1
"a cryptocurrency is a coded string of data representing a currency unit. peer-to-peer networks called blockchains monitor and organize cryptocurrency transactions, such as buying, selling, and transferring, and also serve as secure ledgers of transactions. by utilizing encryption technology, cryptocurrencies can serve as both a currency and an accounting system.",1
"with cryptocurrency, the transaction cost is low to nothing at all—unlike, for example, the fee for transferring money from a digital wallet to a bank account. you can make transactions at any time of the day or night, and there are no limits on purchases and withdrawals. and anyone is free to use cryptocurrency, unlike setting up a bank account, which requires documentation and other paperwork.",1
"in a normal bitcoin transaction, first, there are the transaction details: whom you want to send the bitcoins to and how many bitcoins you want to send. then the information is passed through a hashing algorithm. bitcoin, as mentioned, uses the sha-256 algorithm. the output is then passed through a signature algorithm with the user’s private key, used to uniquely identify the user. the digitally signed output is then distributed across the network for other users to verify. this is done by using the sender’s public key.",1
"you now know that bitcoin is a digital currency that is decentralized and works on the blockchain technology and that it uses a peer-to-peer network to perform transactions. ether is another popular digital currency, and it’s accepted in the ethereum network. the ethereum network uses blockchain technology to create an open-source platform for building and deploying decentralized applications.",1
"bitcoin is used to send money to someone. the way it works is very similar to the way real-life currency works. ether is used as a currency within the ethereum network, although it can be used for real-life transactions as well. bitcoin transactions are done manually, which means you have to personally perform these transactions when you want them done. with ether, you have the option to make transactions manual or automatic—they are programmable, which means the transactions take place when certain conditions have been met. as for timing, it takes about 10 minutes to perform a bitcoin transaction—this is the time it takes for a block to be added to the blockchain. with ether, it takes about 20 seconds to do a transaction.",1
"there is a limit to how many bitcoins can exist: 21 million. this number is supposed to be reached by the year 2140. ether is expected to be around for a while and is not to exceed 100 million units. bitcoin is used for transactions involving goods and services, and ether uses blockchain technology to create a ledger to trigger a transaction when a certain condition is met. finally, bitcoin uses the sha-256 algorithm, and ethereum uses the ethash algorithm.",1

"cryptocurrency may be considered as medium of exchange, negotiable instrument, property, and subject of the contract. depending upon the transaction and power of legislation to tax such transaction, tax incidences are pertinent for cryptocurrency. some of the taxes that can be charged include income tax, gift tax, wealth tax, value-added tax, service tax, inheritance tax, transaction tax, capital gain tax, property tax, and many more.",1
"cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that rely on cryptographic algorithms to provide users with a secure medium of exchange: money creation and transactions are controlled by mathematical algorithms (the so-called mining) implemented within the underlying protocol. as opposed to other digital currencies (such as e-gold or linden dollars), which are issued by a central authority, most cryptocurrencies are based on distributed online architectures: they incorporate principles of cryptography directly into their protocol to establish a worldwide, highly secure payment system that does not rely on any government, company, or central bank, but rather on a decentralized network of peers that contribute, through mining, to achieve distributed autonomous consensus (dac) as to the current state of the network.",1
"already a considerable number of such currencies have been deployed so far, yet most of them are still in their early stage of deployment, and it is difficult to say whether or not they will eventually take off. this section will illustrate the objectives and underlying technicalities of some of these cryptocurrencies, which implement a hybrid approach to value creation and distribution by merging the principles of cbpp with more conventional economic thinking. we will refer to these currencies as commons-based cryptocurrencies (cbcc), not because they are themselves commons-based resources (although some of them might be) but because they have been created with a view to support, promote, or incentivize cbpp.",1
"freicon is one of the first cbcc that was designed not only to create a more stable and sustainable economy but also to support commons-based projects. the cryptocurrency implements an approximately 5% annual demurrage fee, so as to encourage the circulation of money in the economy and discourage hoarding. moreover, only 20% of the money created is assigned to the miners and the other 80% is assigned to the freicon foundation, which redistributes these funds over the most socially or ethically valuable community projects.",1
"a clearer example of cbcc is communitycoin proposed by the guifi community network. communitycoin is a cryptocurrency designed for network communities, which features a mechanism of rewards based on the contribution and participation of community members. this currency can, however, only be used for the internal community work-around: users contributing their resources to the network will be able to spend the communitycoins they receive in order to, e.g., buy a secondhand hardware from another community member. the goal is, ultimately, to incentivize the members to work for the community (installing new nodes, creating new services, etc.) and make the community network self-sustainable.",1
"finally, a few cbcc have managed to incorporate their own commons-based agenda directly within the mining protocol itself. this is the case, for instance, of curecoin (whose mining protocol consists in protein folding computations) and gridcoin (contributing to solving scientific problems to the berkeley open infrastructure for network computing). the opportunities are endless, as cryptocurrencies can be designed to implement any sort of cryptographic protocols and money creation policies whatsoever.",1
a certain amount of data normalization had to be done on data obtained from github. this is because coins that are forked from bitcoin’s source code repository continue to take into account values that are obtained from bitcoin.,1
"an example of this would be contributor count. for example, if the bitcoin repository is forked, the new forked code will already read 216 contributors. after changing some code and committing the new changes, the repository will now read 217 contributors. the figure has to be normalized to reflect one contributor for a new coin.",1
"coingecko also measures merged pull requests, i.e., the number of pull requests that had been accepted to be part of the main source code repository. a higher merged pull request figure indicates that more development is happening in the repository.",1
one of the challenges with the developer section is that there is an altcoin (nxt) that is not hosted on github but on bitbucket. the authors had to write custom code to obtain data from bitbucket and roughly map these data into github’s equivalent metrics. as such nxt comparison is not perfectly comparable and there is a possibility that nxt developer interest is underestimated (nxt is ranked 21 in terms of developer activity).,1
"unsurprisingly, these developments have not gone unnoticed by regulators. lawmakers and regulatory agencies around the world are considering introducing, and indeed some have already introduced, some form of regulation for cryptocurrencies. this momentum for regulation has also been motivated, in part, by recent high-profile events such as the failure of the mt. gox bitcoin exchange based in tokyo, japan, and the public prosecutions in the united states and australia for bitcoin-related transactions of illicit goods on the silk road marketplace.",1
"regulatory responses and proposals have, of course, not been uniform but have instead differed greatly across the board. some jurisdictions, such as vietnam and iceland, have instituted some form of ban on the use of digital currencies. other jurisdictions, such as germany and the united states, have introduced limited forms of regulation intended to address targeted regulatory interests such as antimoney laundering and counter-terrorist financing (aml/ctf). still, more jurisdictions are taking a wait-and-see approach, with regulators keeping silent on the issue of regulation. as yet, no consensus has emerged on an optimal or ideal approach to regulating this new technology.",1
"in these circumstances, this chapter articulates and develops a “facilitative” model for cryptocurrency regulation in singapore. this approach recognizes that, while some form of regulation of cryptocurrencies is desirable and even necessary, there is a real risk that blunt, heavy-handed regulation would impede the development of a nascent and productive cryptocurrency industry and ecosystem.",1
"indeed, regulation need not be anti-industry; cryptocurrency regulation can, if well calibrated, reduce business and end-user uncertainty, encourage and incentivize innovation, and enhance the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies for use in a variety of real-world applications. this is consistent with the view espoused by mr. ravi menon, managing director of the mas, at a recent interview with centralbanking.com, where he opined that, in singapore, “digital currencies have a role to play, which is why [the mas has] not sought to ban them, or make it more difficult for them to operate… while there is reason to be cautious about the risks, we have chosen to address these risks in a targeted way so that innovation can continue to take place.”",1
"facilitative cryptocurrency regulation should therefore, by design, ensure appropriate space for innovation and legitimate competition while clamping down on and disincentivizing misconduct and harmful behavior. this would support singapore in becoming a global leader in the development and marketization of cryptocurrency technology, especially if it gains widespread mass-market adoption. ensuring this balance will of course be difficult in practice and the devil will likely lie in the details; the purpose of the facilitative model outlined below is to suggest a useful blueprint or starting point for discussion.",1
"second, a self-regulatory framework involving effective partnership between the industry and regulators must form an integral part of the regulatory architecture for cryptocurrencies.",1
"third, and finally, effective cryptocurrency regulation will require coordination and harmonization with other regulators and jurisdictions, given the decentralized and often transnational character of cryptocurrency transactions and protocols.",1
some alternatives aim to add features such as namecoin which stores data for use as a decentralized domain name system,0
"but obstacles to using cryptocurrencies are high. acquisition and liquidation costs represent barriers to using them as a form of payment. the lack of price stability undermines confidence in using this form of payment in m&as without some type of a collar arrangement within which the value of the purchase price can fluctuate. alternatively, cryptocurrencies if traded on a futures exchange could be hedged against loss of value by buying a futures contract locking in the current price, although this would add to transaction costs. there also are concerns about security, with several instances of theft of bitcoin by hackers. other issues include the general lack of regulation and transparency. government taxing authorities, concerned with the accuracy of the sale price reported for tax purposes, might be quick to audit those involved in bitcoin-financed m&a deals. money laundering also is a potential concern to governments. monies obtained from criminal activities can be used to buy bitcoin, which could then be used to acquire a legitimate business.",1
"if a particular cryptocurrency is able to accept that the government is part of the ecosystem and its community engages with the government meaningfully in creating the ecosystem, that cryptocurrency is likely to become more widely accepted. given that most of the welfare improvement comes from the bottom of the wealth pyramid, emerging markets have the upper hand in harnessing the low-hanging fruits of cryptocurrency via a decentralized but not necessary distributed system. a cryptocurrency that addresses those issues mentioned will have a bright future.",1
"cryptocurrencies can also be used as financial securities, like stocks. in this context, they can be used by blockchain start-ups as a means to fund projects or business ideas by issuing digital ‘tokens’ (or new cryptocurrencies) to subscribers who pay using mechanisms including prominent cryptocurrencies–such as bitcoin or ethereum–or through fiat currency in order to acquire proprietary interests in the business or project.",1
some firms have used this as a mechanism to raise finance to start businesses. these start-ups would have found it almost impossible to raise finance through the traditional initial public offering (ipo) method due to regulatory requirements they would not have been able to fulfil.,1
"under an ipo, companies need to be listed on a domestic stock exchange and, to do so, are required to fulfil prospectus requirements including disclosure of their accounts. this method is designed to protect retail investors and preserve market integrity.",1
"as the true identities of parties are largely unknown, and as regulation within this space is sparse in most countries, firms seeking funding in this way currently are usually not obliged to know their subscribers under, for example, anti-money laundering (aml) requirements, which makes these platforms easy targets for miscreants. given the weak financial regulatory framework in numerous african countries, this presents a huge problem for both investor protection and the monitoring of aml and terrorism financing. so, although icos can benefit african entrepreneurs/smes, they raise the same regulatory issues and concerns as those raised in the case of equity crowdfunding. although a global regulatory approach to regulating icos is very needful for the financing of businesses internationally – as noted above, they can be described as a type of equity crowdfunding or very similar to this – attracting investor interest predominantly on the basis of their network, which, as seen above, is predominantly national and regional–d therefore calls for a coordinated regional regulatory approach for their operation across the continent.",1
"in fact, these three must intersect in order for any medium of exchange to endure as common currency. if these characteristics falter, so will the users' faith in that currency to the extent that he or she may seek a substitution for that medium of exchange.",1

"bitcoin and ethereum are down more than 50% from their all-time highs in late 2021. while there have been small surges in recent weeks, the crypto market as a whole is largely stalled. while no one knows for sure, some experts say crypto prices could fall even further before any sustained recovery.",1
"bitcoin hit multiple new all-time high prices in 2021 — followed by big drops — and more institutional buy-in from major companies. ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency, notched its own new all-time high late last year as well, and then crashed below $900 in june, its lowest level since the start of 2021. u.s. government officials and the biden administration have increasingly expressed interest in new regulations for cryptocurrency.",1
"all the while, people’s interest in crypto remains high: it’s a hot topic not only among investors but in popular culture too, thanks to everyone from long-standing investors like elon musk to that kid from your high school on facebook.",1
"in many ways, 2021 was a “breakthrough,” says dave abner, head of global development at gemini, a popular cryptocurrency exchange. “there’s tremendous focus and attention being paid to [the crypto industry].”",1
"it’s difficult to predict where things are headed long-term, but in the coming months, experts are following things like regulation and institutional adoption of crypto payments to try and get a better sense of the market.",1
"lawmakers in washington d.c. and across the world are trying to figure out how to establish laws and guidelines to make cryptocurrency safer for investors and less appealing to cybercriminals, so expect continued conversations about cryptocurrency regulation.",1
"u.s officials have shown a particular interest in stablecoin regulation, especially following the recent terra luna crash. in may, crypto markets went into a freefall that led stablecoins terrausd (ust) to depeg from the dollar, which in turn, caused its linked cryptocurrency luna to crash as well. as of a result, many terra and luna investors saw their investments vanish in a matter of days. within a few weeks of terra’s downfall, the crypto market plunged again and several crypto companies announced layoffs and froze withdrawals to slash costs due to the extreme market conditions. some companies like three arrows capital and celsius have since filed for bankruptcy.",1
"“after the catastrophic events that have unfolded in the crypto market over the past few weeks, it is clear that stringent regulation could arrive soon,” says marcus sotiriou, a market analyst at digital asset broker globalblock. “the collapse of defi lenders could be the reason that regulators have been looking for to implement draconian controls over cryptocurrency.”",1
"while there’s still a long way to go, 2022 has so far seen some progress on the regulatory front. president joe biden signed an executive order in march that called on government agencies to study the “responsible development” of digital assets, including stablecoins. the u.s. treasury department recently published the first framework to stem from president biden’s executive order on digital assets, which outlines how the u.s. should engage with other countries in regard to digital assets.",0
"in 2021, federal reserve chair jerome powell said that he had “no intention” of banning cryptocurrency in the u.s while security and exchange commission chairman gary gensler has consistently commented on both his own agency’s and the commodity futures trading commission’s role in policing the industry.",1
"gensler has said on several different occasions that investors are likely to get hurt if stricter regulation is not introduced. plus, the irs has an obvious interest in making sure investors know how to report virtual currency when they file their taxes. powell’s and gensler’s comments are consistent with an emerging view among the biden administration and other u.s. lawmakers that more cryptocurrency regulation is needed.",1
"“more broadly, the public right now would benefit from investor protection around these various service providers … the exchanges, the lending platforms, and the broker-dealers,” gensler said in a recent interview. “so, we at the sec, are working in each of those three fields — exchanges, lending, and the broker-dealers — and talking to industry participants about how to come into compliance, or modify some of that compliance.”",1
"like most things with cryptocurrency, regulation comes with hurdles. “there are different agencies that may or may not have jurisdiction to oversee everything,” says jeffrey wang, head of the americas at amber group, a canada-based crypto finance firm. “and it differs state by state.”",1
"clear regulation would mean the removal of a “significant roadblock for cryptocurrency,” says wang, since u.s. firms and investors are operating without clear guidelines at the moment.",1
"more regulation could mean more stability in a notoriously volatile crypto market. it also has the potential to protect long-term investors, prevent fraudulent activity within the crypto ecosystem, and provide clear guidance to allow companies to innovate in the crypto economy — as long as it strikes the right balance.",1
"“sensible regulation is a win for everyone,” says ben weiss, ceo and cofounder of coinflip, a cryptocurrency buying platform and crypto atm network. “it gives people more confidence in crypto, but i think it’s something we have to take our time on and we have to get it right.”",1
regulatory announcements can also affect the price of cryptocurrency in already volatile markets. market volatility is why experts recommend keeping any cryptocurrency investments to less than 5% of your total portfolio and never investing anything you’re not ok with losing.,1
"mainstream companies across multiple industries took interest — and in some cases themselves invested in — cryptocurrency and blockchain in 2021. amc, for example, announced last year it would accept bitcoin payments. fintech companies like paypal and square are also betting on crypto by allowing users to buy on their platforms. tesla accepts dogecoin payments and continues to go back and forth on its acceptance of bitcoin payments, though the company holds billions in crypto assets. experts predict more and more of this buy-in.",1
"“we’ve seen a tremendous amount of inflow of attention, and that’s going to continue to drive the growth of the industry for a while now,” says abner.",1
"some experts predict bigger, global corporations could jumpstart this adoption even more in the latter half of this year. “what we’re looking at is institutions getting involved in crypto, whether it’s amazon or the big banks,” says weiss. a huge retailer like amazon could “create a chain reaction of others accepting it,” and would “add a lot of credibility.”",1
"indeed, amazon has recently sparked rumors that it’s making moves to that end by sharing a job posting for a “digital currency and blockchain product lead.”",0
"while paying for things in cryptocurrencies doesn’t make sense for most people right now, more retailers accepting payments might change that landscape in the future. we’re likely still a long way off before it’ll be a smart financial decision to spend bitcoin on goods or services, but further institutional adoption could bring about more use-cases for everyday users, and in turn, have an impact on crypto prices. nothing is guaranteed, but if you buy cryptocurrency as a long-term store of value, the more “real world” uses it has, the more likely demand and value will increase.",1
"nfts represent digital ownership of a wide range of irreplicable intangible items, and have drawn the attention of celebrities and big companies ranging from american express to gucci. total nft sales hit $25 billion in 2021, compared to $94.9 million the year before, according to data collected by dappradar, an app store for decentralized applications.",0
"but there continues to be debate about whether nfts are here to stay or simply a fad. nft sales in june fell under $1 billion for the first time in 12 months, according to dappradar data.",1
"experts remain split on it, with some screaming “bubble,” while others claim it’s the technology behind nfts — the smart contracts on blockchain technology — that offer real value. meanwhile, creators and artists are claiming this is the next form of monetization.",0
"“i do think that right now they’re very trendy, especially the last four months,” says humphrey yang, personal finance expert behind humphreytalks.“in 10 or 20 years, i think they’ll still be around. how much we use them — that i don’t know. people will still always find some value in communities, but the broader applications of nfts will be more interesting.”",1
"recent data shows the market may be finally cooling off. almost a million accounts were actively buying or selling nfts at the start of the year, but that number has since declined to about 491,000, a recent report by chainalysis found. some experts expect the nft market to continue to suffer because of the declining price of cryptocurrencies, along with other macroeconomic conditions like inflation, rising interest rates, and russia’s war in ukraine.",1
"over the past year, many people bought nfts as either investments or simply because they are fun or bring them joy. regardless of the reason, many of those digital assets are now worth a lot less because of the crypto market’s downfall in recent months.",1
"from an investing perspective, buying an nft is “even riskier” than buying crypto because it’s “almost like a leveraged bet on crypto,” according to yang. “it’s essentially gambling but people don’t really know the difference and they buy them because they’re fun,” he says.",0
"knowing that nfts are even more risky and speculative than crypto, you should likely stay away from them, especially while there’s a general decline in crypto prices. experts say most long-term investors will be better served by allocating only a small portion of their portfolio (less than 5%, and never at the expense of meeting other financial goals) to bitcoin or ethereum, two of the largest cryptocurrencies, rather than to an nft.",1
"if you’re invested in crypto, you’ve probably come across the term “defi.” it stands for “decentralized finance,” and refers to an online world of alternative financial services powered by cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.",1
"defi uses “smart contracts” to replace traditional intermediaries like banks and lenders. essentially, the businesses that we interact with everyday to manage our finances are replaced by software. because of this, there’s no central authority to report to in the defi space.",1
"but defi is still in its relative infancy — similar to how the early days of the internet had a “wild west” feel of basic chat rooms, rudimentary websites, and early online service providers. with that in mind, there are going to be some bumps and bruises along the way with its development, experts say, but there could be an amazon or google of the future in the defi space in time.",0
"further refinement is the next important step for defi, according to dr. merav ozair, blockchain expert and a fintech professor at rutgers business school. “the next step is figuring out how to make good code and kick everything up a notch,” he says.",1
"but that can come at a cost — there are fewer regulatory guardrails to keep your assets safe. defi is the “wild west” of banking and investing in many ways, where if you lose your assets to hackers or through other means, there may be no way to recover them.",1
"it’s still early for defi, so if you’re comparing conventional financial products to defi products, it’s smart to weigh the risks against the potential rewards. you’ll take more risks with your money in the defi space since it’s unregulated, but you’ll also have more freedom and control. you’ll first need to buy crypto for access, and have a decent amount of crypto knowledge under your belt to get started.",1
"experts say it’s best to have no more than 5% of your overall portfolio tied up in crypto, and only to go that far after you’ve built up an emergency fund and paid off any high-interest debt.",1
"bitcoin is a good indicator of the crypto market in general, because it’s the largest cryptocurrency by market cap and the rest of the market tends to follow its trends.",1
"bitcoin’s price had a wild ride in 2021, and last november set another new all-time high price when it went over $68,000. but then it came crashing down in 2022.",1
"bitcoin and the broader crypto market have been sinking this year amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty that’s mostly been driven by surging inflation, a shaky stock market, rising interest rates, and recession fears. bitcoin has lost more than two-thirds of its value since last november, and dipped as low as $17,500 in recent weeks. experts remain conflicted on whether bitcoin has bottomed out yet. some say it already has, while others says bitcoin could fall as low as $10,000 in 2022.",1
"but how high will bitcoin go in the long term? while it’s been a rocky start to the year for bitcoin, but experts still say it will hit $100,000 — and that it’s more a matter of when, not if. bitcoin’s past may provide some clues as to what to expect looking forward, according to kiana danial, author of “cryptocurrency investing for dummies.”",1
danial says there have been plenty of huge spikes followed by pullbacks in bitcoin’s price since 2011. “what i expect from bitcoin is volatility short-term and growth long-term.”,1
"ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency and most well-known altcoin in the market. like bitcoin, it can also serve as a good measure of the crypto market. in the last six years, it has grown immensely in value — from $0.311 at its 2015 launch to around $4,800 at its highest late last year.",1
"experts say that number could depend on the success of ethereum’s massive upgrade, which is set for sept. 19. ethereum is transitioning its technology to a less energy-intensive version that insiders colloquially refer to as “the merge.” the upgrade also promises to make the network more efficient, faster, and cheaper to use.",1
"if ethereum lives up to its promises with the merge, experts say ether could once again break $4,000 in 2022 and even possibly go as high as $12,000. investors are closely watching every step leading up to the merge and in some cases taking advantage of the current market downturn by buying the dip ahead of it. only time will tell if ethereum’s price will continue to climb or fall back down to previous lows, according to experts.",1
"“this is going to be a very important year for ethereum, a kind of a make-or-break year.”said henri arslanian, global crypto leader of the professional services firm pwc.",1
"bitcoin and ethereum’s volatility is more reason for investors to play a steady long game. if you’re buying for long-term growth potential, then don’t worry about short-term swings. the best thing you can do is not look at your cryptocurrency investment, or “set it and forget it.” as experts continue to tell us each time there’s a price swing — whether up or down — emotional reaction can cause investors to act rashly and make decisions that result in losses on their investment.",1
"we can speculate on what value cryptocurrency may have for investors in the coming months and years (and many will), but the reality is it’s still a new and speculative investment, without much history on which to base predictions. no matter what a given expert thinks or says, no one really knows. that’s why it’s important to only invest what you’re prepared to lose, and stick to more conventional investments for long-term wealth building.",1

"cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency that relies on cryptography and blockchain technology to enable users to send and receive the currency without a trusted third party. the most popular cryptocurrency out there, bitcoin, works by having numerous computers running a complex math puzzle in order to verify blocks (hence: blockchain) which contain all the new transactions made on the network. once they do, they get bitcoins as reward, making it lucrative for them to power the network. since it takes vast computational power to beat all of these computers at math, this makes bitcoin secure from attackers who would want to falsify transactions. besides bitcoin, there are numerous other cryptocurrencies, each with a different goal. best known among them is ethereum, which uses similar basic principles as bitcoin in order to power a network for decentralized applications.",1

"while many cryptocurrencies share a blockchain-based infrastructure, there are some striking differences between them. generally speaking, cryptocurrency can be clustered into two distinct categories: coins and tokens.",1
"like coins, tokens are also digital assets that can be bought and sold. however, tokens are a non-native asset, meaning that they use another blockchain’s infrastructure. these include tether, which is hosted on the ethereum blockchain, and others, including terrausd, chainlink, uniswap, and polygon.",1
"bitcoin was the world’s first cryptocurrency, with its origins dating back to a white paper published in 2008, and remains the best-known type of crypto. it functions on its own blockchain, with transactions verified (and new bitcoins created, up to a fixed cap) by an army of decentralized miners. in january 2022, bitcoin was the cryptocurrency with the largest market cap, at us$896 billion.",1
"ether is the cryptocurrency that runs on the ethereum blockchain. like bitcoin, ether operates on its own blockchain—but unlike bitcoin, ether is uncapped, meaning that an infinite number of coins can theoretically be created. ethereum also supports smart contracts, which are programs that run on the ethereum blockchain and are executed automatically when certain conditions are met.",1
"binance coin is native to binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange as of 2021. transaction fees for this exchange are reduced for users who choose to pay in bnb. this has encouraged the adoption of binance coin, making it one of the largest cryptocoins in the market. to ensure its value remains stable, binance destroys or “burns” a fixed percentage of the coins in circulation.",1
"tether is a type of stablecoin, designed to have a less-volatile price by being linked to an external asset. in this case, each coin is backed by an equivalent number of us dollars, which keeps it from experiencing the same kind of pricing volatility that other cryptocurrencies face.  there is however, some debate about whether it truly is fully backed by the dollar.",0

"much like tether, usd coin is a stablecoin connected to the us dollar that cannot be mined. however, unlike tether, usd coin has more transparent funding and better auditing processes. the aim is to remove some of the risk associated with crypto, as users should always be able to withdraw their coins and receive the corresponding amount of cash in exchange.",1
"luna is the native coin of the terra blockchain, and backs the various stablecoins created on this network. terra's algorithmic stablecoins are backed by luna, and use a central pool of tokens controlled by smart contracts to maintain the price.",1
"for example, if the price of terrausd (a stablecoin on the terra network tied to the usd) goes above $1, the algorithm uses luna to produce more ust and bring the price back down. if the price falls, the algorithm swaps ust for luna to push it back up. token holders can stake luna so they're rewarded for absorbing the volatility. luna can also be used to pay network fees and allows owners to participate in matters relating to the governance of this network.",1

"unctad said their benefits to some are overshadowed by the threats they pose to financial stability, domestic resource mobilization, and the security of monetary systems.",1
"the use of cryptocurrency rose globally at an unprecedented rate during the covid-19 pandemic, reinforcing a trend that was already in motion. some 19,000 are currently in existence.",1
"the first brief – all that glitters is not gold: the high cost of leaving cryptocurrencies unregulated – examines the reasons behind the rapid uptake of cryptocurrencies in developing countries, including facilitation of remittances and as a hedge against currency and inflation risks.",1
"unctad also highlighted the particular risk that stablecoins pose in developing countries with unmet demand for reserve currencies.  as their name implies, stablecoins are designed to maintain stability as their value is pegged to another currency, commodity or financial instrument.",1
"“for some of these reasons, the international monetary fund has expressed the view that cryptocurrencies pose risks as legal tender,” the agency said.",1
"“it is argued that a domestic digital payment system that serves as a public good could fulfil at least some of the reasons for crypto use and limit the expansion of cryptocurrencies in developing countries,” said unctad.",0
"for example, monetary authorities could provide a central bank digital currency or a fast retail payment system, though measures will depend on national capacities and needs.",1
"however, unctad has urged governments “to maintain the issuance and distribution of cash”, given the risk of deepening the digital divide in developed countries.",0
"the final policy brief discusses how cryptocurrencies have become a new channel for undermining domestic resource mobilization in developing countries, and warns of the dangers of doing too little, too late.",1
"while cryptocurrencies can facilitate remittances, unctad warned that they may also enable tax evasion and avoidance through illicit financial flows – similar to a tax haven, where ownership is not easily identifiable.",1
"the agency urged authorities to regulate crypto exchanges, digital wallets and decentralized finance to ensure the comprehensive financial regulation of cryptocurrencies.",1
"furthermore, regulated financial institutions should be banned from holding cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, or offering related products to their clients.",1
"additionally, capital controls should be redesigned to take account of what the agency described as “the decentralized, borderless and pseudonymous features of cryptocurrencies”.",1

"cryptocurrencies use cryptography to secure transactions and regulate the creation of additional units. bitcoin, the original and by far most well-known cryptocurrency, was launched in january 2009. today there are over 1,500 cryptocurrencies available online.",1
"cryptocurrencies differ significantly from traditional currencies as they use blockchain technology to create a distributed ledger. nonetheless, you can still buy and sell them like any other currency and can also trade on the price movements of various cryptocurrencies via cfds.",1
"a feature of most cryptocurrencies is that they have been designed to slowly reduce production and some have an absolute limit on supply. consequently, in some cases only a limited number of units of the currency will ever be in circulation. for example, the number of bitcoins is not expected to exceed 21 million. cryptocurrencies such as ethereum, on the other hand, work slightly differently. issuance is capped at 18 million ethereum tokens per year, which equals 25% of the initial supply. limiting the number gives it higher value.",1
"cryptocurrencies use advanced cryptography in a number of ways. in today’s digital world it’s based primarily on computer science and mathematical theory. it also draws from communication science, physics and electrical engineering.",1
"a blockchain is the decentralised, public ledger or list of a cryptocurrency’s transactions. completed blocks, comprised of the latest transactions, are recorded and added to the blockchain. they are stored in chronological order as an open, permanent and verifiable record. an ever evolving network of market participants manage blockchains, and they follow a set protocol for validating new blocks. each ‘node’ or computer connected to the network automatically downloads a copy of the blockchain. this allows everyone to track transactions without the need for central record keeping.",1
"blockchain technology creates a record that can’t be changed without the agreement of the rest of the network. the blockchain concept is attributed to bitcoin’s founder, satoshi nakamoto. this concept has been the inspiration for other applications beyond digital cash and currency.",1
"coin mining is the process of attaching new transaction records as blocks to the blockchain. in the process – using bitcoin as an example – new bitcoins are credited to the miners, adding to the total number of coins in circulation. mining requires a specific piece of software that is used to solve mathematical puzzles, and this validates the legitimate transactions which make up blocks. these blocks get added to the public ledger (blockchain) at regular intervals. as the software solves transactions the miner is rewarded with a set amount of bitcoins. the faster a miner’s hardware can process the mathematical problem, the more likely it is to validate a transaction and earn the bitcoin reward.",1
"bitcoin is credited as the original and most well-known cryptocurrency. satoshi nakamoto, a person or group of people under the name created it in 2009. as of december 2017, there were around 16.7 million bitcoins in circulation (there may be a finite number of 21 million available). traders can purchase bitcoin through an exchange and speculate on its price movements via cfds. learn more about bitcoin and how to trade it.",1
"ethereum is relatively new in the cryptocurrency world. it launched in 2015 and at the time of writing is currently the second largest digital currency network. it operates in a similar way to the bitcoin network, allowing people to send and receive tokens representing value via an open network. the tokens are called ether, and this is what is used as payment on the network. ethereum’s primary use, however, is to operate as smart contracts rather than as a form of payment. smart contracts are scripts of code which can be deployed in the ethereum blockchain. the limit on ether also works slightly differently to bitcoin. yearly issuance is capped at 18 million ether which equals 25% of the initial supply. learn more about ethereum.",1
"bitcoin cash (bch) is a cryptocurrency and payment network created as a result of a hard fork with bitcoin in december 2017. a hard fork occurs when members of the cryptocurrency community have a disagreement, usually regarding improvements to the software used within the network. in this case it was a disagreement around a proposal to increase the block size. after a fork, the blockchain splits in two and it is left to the miners and the wider community to decide which cryptocurrency to align themselves with. when the bitcoin hard fork took place, one bitcoin cash token was typically awarded for every bitcoin held (although some exchanges chose not to recognise bitcoin cash).",1
"bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can best be described as alternative currencies. as noted above, they are not yet widely accepted today as a medium of exchange. the outlook for cryptocurrencies is binary – it’s likely they’ll either fail or take over the world. this is some of the factors that drives the higher risk and higher potential reward nature of cryptocurrency market.learn more about the other cryptocurrencies available to trade with cmc markets.",1

"with that said, cryptocurrencies remain controversial. while critics including economist paul krugman and warren buffet have called bitcoin “evil” and a “mirage,” others, such as venture capitalist marc andreessen, tout them as “the next internet.” for every person declaring that cryptocurrencies are in a bubble, there’s another insisting that they are the next wave of the democratization of finance. at their simplest, they are merely the newest fintech fad; yet at the most complex level, they’re a revolutionary technology challenging the political, economic, and social underpinnings of society.",1
"cryptocurrencies are digital assets that use cryptography, an encryption technique, for security. cryptocurrencies are primarily used to buy and sell goods and services, though some newer cryptocurrencies also function to provide a set of rules or obligations for its holders—something we will discuss later. they possess no intrinsic value in that they are not redeemable for another commodity, such as gold. unlike traditional currency, they are not issued by a central authority and are not considered legal tender.",1
"at this point, use of cryptocurrencies is largely limited to “early adopters.” for scale, there are around 10 million bitcoin holders worldwide, with around half holding bitcoin purely for investment purposes. objectively, cryptocurrencies are not necessary because government-backed currencies function adequately. for most adopters, the advantages of cryptocurrencies are theoretical. therefore, mainstream adoption will only come when there is a significant tangible benefit of using a cryptocurrency. so what are the advantages to using them?",1
"one of the biggest benefits of cryptocurrencies is that they do not involve financial institution intermediaries. for merchants, the lack of a “middleman” lowers transaction costs. for consumers, there’s a tremendous advantage if the financial system is hacked or if the user does not trust the traditional system. for comparison’s sake, if a bank’s database were hacked or damaged, the bank would be completely reliant on its backups to restore any missing information. with cryptocurrencies, even if a portion were compromised, the remaining portions would continue to be able to confirm transactions.",1
"still, cryptocurrencies are not completely immune from security threats. in one of the “largest digital heists in history,” the decentralized autonomous organization (dao), a decentralized fund intended to democratize the funding of ethereum projects, was hacked. the decentralized application (dapp) built on top of the ethereum currency was hacked and hackers gained control of one-third of the fund ($55 million). fortunately, most of the funds were restored. however, the incident shook the community and prompted the sec’s decision to subject offerings and exchanges to us securities laws.",1
"another distinguishing feature of blockchain technology is its accessibility for involved parties. it’s akin to google docs, where multiple parties can access the ledger at once, in real time. today, if you write a friend a check, you and your friend balance your respective checkbooks when it’s deposited. but things start to go awry if your friend forgets to update their checkbook ledger, or if you don’t have enough in your bank account to cover the check (which the bank has no way of knowing beforehand).",1
"with blockchain, you and your friend would view the same ledger of transactions. the ledger is not controlled by either of you, but it operates on consensus, so both of you need to approve and verify the transaction for it to be added to the chain. the chain is also secured with cryptography, and significantly, no one can change the chain after the fact.",1
"from a technical perspective, the blockchain utilizes consensus algorithms, and transactions are recorded in multiple nodes instead of on one server. a node is a computer connected to the blockchain network, which automatically downloads a copy of the blockchain upon joining the network. for a transaction to be valid, all nodes need to be in agreement.",1
"though blockchain technology was conceived as part of bitcoin in 2009, there may be many other applications. technology consulting firm cb insights has identified 27 ways it can fundamentally change processes as diverse as banking, cybersecurity, voting, and academics. the swedish government, for example, is testing the use of blockchain technology to record land transactions, which are currently recorded on paper and transmitted through physical mail. the world economic forum estimates that by 2027, 10% of global gdp will be stored on blockchain technology.",1
“mining” refers to a step whereby two things occur: cryptocurrency transactions are verified and new units of the cryptocurrency are created. effective mining requires both powerful hardware and software.,1
"when it comes to verification, an individual computer isn’t powerful enough to profitably mine cryptocurrencies because you’d run up your power bill. to address this, miners often join pools to increase collective computing power, allocating miner profits to participants.  groups of miners compete to verify pending transactions and reap the profits, leveraging specialized hardware and cheap electricity. this competition helps to ensure the integrity of transactions.",1
"the largest pools include antpool, f2pool, and bitfury, with antpool alone controlling over 19% of all mining. most mining pools are located in china, comprising more than 70% of total bitcoin mining. china manufactures most cryptocurrency mining equipment and leverages the country’s cheap electricity prices.",1
"cryptocurrency exchanges are websites where individuals can buy, sell, or exchange cryptocurrencies for other digital currency or traditional currency. the exchanges can convert cryptocurrencies into major government-backed currencies, and can convert cryptocurrencies into other cryptocurrencies. some of the largest exchanges include poloniex, bitfinex, kraken, and gdax, which can trade more than $100 million (equivalent) per day. almost every exchange is subject to government anti-money laundering regulations, and customers are required to provide proof of identity when opening an account.",1
"instead of exchanges, people sometimes use peer-to-peer transactions via sites like localbitcoins, which allow traders to avoid disclosing personal information. in a peer-to-peer transaction, participants trade cryptocurrencies in transactions via software without the involvement of any other intermediary.",1
"in contrast, a software wallet such as the coinbase wallet is virtual. this type of software device can place the holder’s funds online in the possession of the wallet provider, which has added risk. coinbase introduced its vault service to increase the security of its wallet.",0
"currently, there are two major categories of cryptocurrencies: those utilized for the purchase of goods and services and those that allow for the creation of “smart contracts,” which are agreements that enforce themselves via code rather than courts. we’ll discuss both in this section.",1
"according to experts in the industry, “there won’t be one supreme digital currency…a kind of crypto-pluralism is taking hold.” though bitcoin and ethereum comprise the majority of the cryptocurrency market share (see chart 2 below), we’ve seen the emergence and rapid growth of many new technologies. in fact, there are over 1,000 cryptocurrencies in existence right now (called “altcoins”); over 600 have market capitalizations of over $100,000.",1
"although bitcoin is widely recognized as pioneering, it is not without limitations. for example, it can only process seven transactions a second. by contrast, visa handles thousands of transactions per second. the time it takes to confirm transactions has also risen. not only is bitcoin slower than some of its alternatives, but its functionality is also limited. this is reflected in its market share, which has fallen from 81% in june 2016, to 40% nearly two years later. while bitcoin’s price has generally been following an upward trend, in early 2018 bitcoin’s price fell sharply, dipping below $8,000 as news of tougher regulation from china and south korea surfaced (to be discussed in a subsequent section). bitcoin’s price also fell following announcements of sec crackdown on crypto exchanges and after binance was reportedly hacked. other currencies like bitcoin include litecoin, zcash and dash, which claim to provide greater anonymity.",1
"often used interchangeably, ethereum is a platform that allows for relatively easy creation of smart contracts while ether is a “token” used to enter into transactions on the ethereum blockchain. put simply, smart contracts are computer programs that can automatically execute the terms of a contract. they function similarly to the “if (then)” excel function: when a pre-programmed condition is triggered, the smart contract executes the corresponding contractual clause.",1
"let’s apply this to an example. let’s say you’re a company that creates and sells video game consoles. you work with suppliers and shipping companies, and you’re concerned with ensuring that: 1) the consoles are manufactured well and on time, 2) there are no labor violations, and 3) all parties get paid on time. with traditional operations, numerous contracts would be involved just to manufacture a single console, with each party retaining their own paper copies.",0
"as mentioned previously, cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value—so why all the fuss? people invest in cryptocurrencies for a couple primary reasons. first, there’s a speculative element to cryptocurrency prices which entice investors looking to profit from market value changes. for example, the price of ether appreciated from $8 per unit in january 2017 to almost $400 six months later as the ether market became more bullish—only to decline to $200 per unit in july due to technical issues.",1
"apart from pure speculation, many invest in cryptocurrencies as a geopolitical hedge. during times of political uncertainty, the price of bitcoin tends to increase. as political and economic uncertainty in brazil increased in 2015 and 2016, bitcoin exchange trade increased by 322% while wallet adoption grew by 461%. bitcoin prices also increased in response to brexit and trump victories, and continue to increase alongside trump’s political controversies.",1
"applications of the cryptocurrency. cryptocurrencies require a use case to have any value. a miner of a rare metal may see rapid appreciation in value if it’s used, for example, in the next iphone 8; if the metal is not used, however, it becomes worthless. the same dynamic applies to cryptocurrencies. bitcoin has value as a means of exchange; alternate cryptocurrencies can either improve on the bitcoin model, or have another usage that creates value, such as ether. as uses for cryptocurrencies increase, corresponding demand and value also increase.",1
"technology changes. unlike physical commodities, changes in technology affect cryptocurrency prices. july and august 2017 saw the price of bitcoin negatively impacted by controversy about altering the underlying technology to improve transaction times. once the change was completed, the price of bitcoin shot up—increasing from $2700 to a record high of $4000 in just over two weeks. conversely, news reports of hacking often lead to price decreases.",1
"still, given the volatility of this emerging phenomenon, there is a risk of a crash. many experts have noted that in the event of a cryptocurrency market collapse, that retail investors would suffer the most. according to mohamed damak, s&p global rating sector lead, “for now, a meaningful drop in cryptocurrencies’ market value would be just a ripple across the financial services industry, still too small to disturb stability or affect the creditworthiness of banks we rate.” read more here on the bear case of the cryptocurrency market.",1
"initial coin offerings (icos) are the hot new phenomenon in the cryptocurrency investing space. icos help firms raise cash for the development of new blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. instead of issuing shares of ownership, they offer digital tokens, or “coins.” investors gain early access to the technology, and are able to use it however they see fit. startups are able to raise money without diluting from private investors or venture capitalists. bankers are increasingly abandoning their lucrative positions for their slice of the ico pie.",1
"not convinced of the craze? this year, former mozilla ceo brendan eich raised $35 million from an ico in less than 30 seconds, and bancor protocol raised $153 million in under three hours. additionally, blockchain-related projects have raised more than $1.6 billion via icos to date, while venture capitalists have provided only $550 million for cryptocurrency companies across more than 120 deals.",1
"under current accounting guidelines, cryptocurrencies are most likely not cash or cash equivalents since they lack the liquidity of cash and the stable value of cash equivalents. however, the accounting treatment of cryptocurrencies is still uncertain as there has not been official guidance on the issue from the international finance reporting standards (ifrs) or the american institute of cpas (aicpa).",1
"in the us, irs revenue ruling 2014-21 stated that holders of cryptocurrencies should account for them as personal property, with gains or losses on purchases or sales. the value of cryptocurrency holdings on balance sheets would be at cost or fair market value at the time of receipt. therefore, with the rapid increase in price, sales of cryptocurrencies lead to enormous gains at the time of sale: just consider the capital gains taxes on buying bitcoin at $100 in 2013 and selling it for more than $4,000 in 2017!",1
"outside the us, accounting treatment of cryptocurrencies varies. in the eu, a decision of the european court of justice rules that cryptocurrencies should be treated like government-backed currencies, and that holders should not be taxed on purchases or sales. in countries such as germany and the uk, cryptocurrencies are treated like “private money” and not subject to tax outside of commercial use.",1
"similarly, in japan, cryptocurrencies were recently reclassified as a “means of settlement” of transactions, and thus exempted from japan’s consumption tax. previously, purchases of cryptocurrencies were subject to an 8% consumption tax.",1
"japan has not only legally recognized bitcoin, but also created a regulatory framework to help the industry flourish. this is considered a major step forward for legitimizing cryptocurrencies. however, japan has also mandated that by october 1, any bitcoin or “alternative coin” must be registered with the japan financial services agency and be subjected to annual audits. though the registration is expensive and demanding (including a three-year business plan and anti-money laundering requirements), many parties are rushing to get registered because they recognize that the handsome reward includes “voracious” japanese retail investors. the media has generally praised the new regulatory scheme, though the japanese bitcoin community has criticized the system as hampering innovation. the move follows the major fraud and investor losses from the 2014 mt. gox bitcoin exchange scandal.",1
"mike kayamori, chief executive of the cryptocurrency exchange quoine says, “when you are talking about startups, which of course a lot of the bitcoin-related businesses are, you never really think of regulation as a good thing…but in this case, it just might be different. the retail investor—mrs. watanabe—doesn’t want to be in the wild, wild west. she wants something regulated and trustworthy.”",1
"us regulators are starting to crack down on previously unregulated cryptocurrency activities. take initial coin offerings (icos) for example. despite their popularity, many icos are for new cryptocurrencies with speculative business models, and have been widely criticized as scams.",1
"in response, the sec indicated that tokens issued from icos must be registered under the us securities laws if offered to us residents. since icos can be sold across national borders, it remains to be seen whether ico issuers will choose to comply or simply move transactions outside of the us. due to the pseudonymous nature of ico transactions, it may be difficult for national governments to significantly limit cryptocurrency sales or trading.",1
"regulation is also expanding beyond icos. as of march 2018, the sec is requiring that cryptocurrency trading platforms be formally registered as formal “exchanges” like the new york stock exchange or cboe. this move is a result of concern that cryptocurrency investors believe they are receiving the protections and benefits of a registered exchange when they, in fact, are not. to date, compared to securities brokers, cryptocurrency exchanges have had no capital rules and have been largely unregulated other than for anti-money laundering—something that seems to be subject to change. exchanges registered with the sec will be subject to inspections, required to police their markets, and mandated to follow rules aimed at ensuring fair trading. the sec announcement coincided with a “large-scale” theft attempt on crypto exchange binance.",1
"in contrast, vermont and arizona have embraced the new technology. both states passed laws providing legal standing to facts or records tied to a blockchain, including smart contracts. arizona also passed a second law prohibiting blockchain technology from being used to track the location or control of a firearm.",1
"computer hacking and theft continue to be impediments to widespread acceptance. these issues have continued to rise in tandem with the popularity of cryptocurrencies. in july 2017, one of the five largest bitcoin and ethereum exchanges (bithumb was hacked, resulting in the theft of user information as well as hundreds of millions of korean won. the ftc also recorded an increase in identity fraud complaints of more than 100% between 2013 and 2016, and coinbase, the largest us-based exchange, saw account hacking double between november and december 2016.",1
"the pseudonymous nature of blockchain and bitcoin transactions also raises other concerns. in a typical centralized transaction, if the good or service is defective, the transaction can be cancelled and the funds returned to the buyer. however, in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, there isn’t a central organization to facilitate recourse against the seller.",1
"despite advancements since their inception, cryptocurrencies rouse both ire and admiration from the public. the challenge proponents must solve for is advancing the technology to its full potential while building the public confidence necessary for mainstream adoption. after all, critics are not entirely wrong. clearly, there’s a lot of hype surrounding the space. bitcoin’s price reflects expectations that are not necessarily supported by reality, and it’s not hard to imagine a day when another cryptocurrency will overshadow it. bitcoin and its investors could end up like brick and mortar stores, eclipsed by the next big thing. new cryptocurrency advancements are often accompanied by a slew of risks: theft of cryptocurrency wallets is on the rise, and fraud continues to cast an ominous shadow on the industry. this tension between promise and peril makes this new world unlike anything we’ve experienced before.",1
"still, cryptocurrencies and blockchain could be truly transformative. imagine an election where vote totals are confirmed by hundreds of nodes operating in an open source environment instead of a single government agency’s computer. or where the purchase and sale of real estate no longer requires signed documents or an official “closing”—just the transfer of a cryptocurrency backed by a smart contract. the only limit is your imagination.",1
"as richard branson puts it, “i’m not sure if anybody knows exactly how emerging payment technologies are going to change the world for good in the long-term – i certainly don’t. but i’m convinced they are going to have a big, positive impact, and am excited about going on the journey.”",0
"cryptocurrencies are primarily used to buy and sell goods and services, though some newer cryptocurrencies also function to provide a set of rules or obligations for its holders.",1
"cryptocurrency wallets are necessary for users to send and receive digital currency and monitor their balance. wallets can be either hardware or software, though hardware wallets are considered more secure.",1
"during mining, two things occur: cryptocurrency transactions are verified and new units are created. effective mining requires powerful hardware and software. miners often join pools to increase collective computing power, splitting profits between participants. groups of miners compete to verify transactions.",1
"released in 2009 by satoshi nakamoto (alias), bitcoin is the most well known of all cryptocurrencies. in a bitcoin transaction, the buyer and seller utilize mobile wallets to send and receive payments. although bitcoin is  recognized as pioneering, it is it can only process seven transactions a second.",1
"the bitcoin supply is limited by code in the bitcoin blockchain. the rate of increase of the supply of bitcoin decreases until bitcoin reaches 21 million, expected to happen in 2140. as bitcoin adoption increases, the slowing growth in the number of bitcoins assures that the price of bitcoin will continue to grow.",1
"cryptocurrency market size and technology  the cryptocurrency market cap has been projected to reach as high as $1-2 trillion in 2018. the market cap of bitcoin exceeded $70 billion, with peak trading volumes around $3 billion per day. technology consulting firm cb insights has identified 27 ways blockchain can fundamentally change processes as diverse as banking, cybersecurity, voting, and academics. the world economic forum estimates that by 2027, 10% of global gdp will be stored on blockchain technology. most mining pools are located in china, comprising more than 70% of total bitcoin mining. china manufactures most cryptocurrency mining equipment and leverages the country’s cheap electricity prices.",1
"investing in cryptocurrencies   supply and demand matters. the rate of increase of the supply of bitcoin will decrease until the number of bitcoin reaches 21 million, which is expected to take place in the year 2140. similarly, the supply of litecoin will be capped at 84 million units. initial coin offerings are trending right now. this year, former mozilla ceo brendan eich raised $35 million from an ico in less than 30 seconds, and bancor protocol raised $153 million in under three hours. blockchain-related projects have raised more than $1.6 billion via icos to date, while venture capitalists have provided only $550 million for cryptocurrency companies.",1

as you know bitcoin is a decentralized currency that’s not controlled by any government or banking agencies to start with you should always enable two factor authentication and use a very strong password that should include characters symbols and must be case sensitive in order to avoid your bitcoin account being hacked and your coins stolen. on easter sunday  i was doing research and saw an advertisement about cryptocurrency mining and after what i thought was an intensive investigation i decided to invest 0.9 btc as a starter and was promised 30% return on investment hourly. after the hour went by i was swindled into investing more bitcoin with the promise of an upgrade which would lead to a higher return of investment to cut the story short i invested a total of 2 btc with the allure of getting 8 btc back and after trying to get my promised payment i would always be asked to make more payments and they refused to give me my initial return on investment that’s when i woke up and smelled the coffee that my hard earned money was fraudulently taken away from me so as you know i had to do more research on how to get my bitcoin back. i googled a few recovery companies and after a few days of research i came across a crypto expert who introduced me to a programmer that helped me recover my lost coins . i was very skeptical as can be imagined but i’m glad to say my bitcoin was recovered and sent back to me after 4 working days. you should file a complaint directly to him - ( christopherhardisty9@gmail.com  /solutionglobalrecovery@consultant.com  / info@solutionglobalrecovery.com _) in case u need help recovering ur lost transactions,1

"with the spread of the global coronavirus pandemic (covid-19), the relationship between bitcoin and the equity market has expanded.  for example, following a severe drop in the s&p index in the u.s. on march 12, 2020, the price of bitcoin plummeted below usd 4,000. due to the collapse of the initial coin offering (ico) market, blockchain firms are now largely attempting to obtain investment funding. to alleviate the economic consequences of the covid-19 pandemic, large blockchain enterprises such as elliptic, chainalysis, and ciphertrace have indicated that they have cut their workforce or budgets. elliptic, for example, has laid off 30% of its staff in the united states and uk; ciphertrace has reduced advertising and marketing department roles, and chainalysis has announced plans to slash employee pay by 10%.",1
"the constraints and economic problems induced by coronavirus have left several token sales without investment while causing others to delay their production. the recent research study by icobench in 2020 reveals that the contributions made by the companies during the last week of january to the first week of february were significantly smaller in the same timeframe compared to last year. moreover, the virus spread has forced crypto companies to implement work from home strategy and has delayed many business partnerships.",1
"although the long-term impact of covid-19 on economies cannot be predicted, considering the cultures and individuals’ well-being, it seems a reasonable bet that the reaction of central banks would build an ideal atmosphere for the market to sustain. if bitcoin continues to outperform conventional markets, it may certainly spark further interest in crypto as an alternate and sustainable form of currency.",1
"the popularity of virtual or digital currency such as bitcoins, litecoins, ethers, and many more are expected to drive the market in the forthcoming years. people from developed countries are likely to adopt the easy and flexible transactional method offered by digital currency. this popularity of virtual currency as an exchanging medium led the central bank to support digital currency. the central bank patented central bank digital currency (cbdc) activity provisions for the digital currency projects across many developed countries. for instance, the bank of thailand and central bank of uruguay are applying the toolkit to its cbdc evaluation process; the eastern caribbean central bank and people’s bank of china also support cbdc for adopting digital cash as an exchange medium. several companies, such as facebook, inc., are expanding their business by offering digital money. for instance, in june 2019, facebook, inc. launched a digital currency named libra. libra will enable customers to buy things or send money to others and cash out libra online or at grocery shops. additionally, companies can benefit from fluctuating digital currency prices and strengthen their digital assets.",1
"financial disaster is a major issue occurring in traditional banking and the financial sector. financial uncertainty disturbs the economy by dropping the value of the currency. for instance, india’s icici bank had majorly confronted the lehman brother crisis in 2008, which affected the nation’s economy. with bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies, there is no major effect of the financial crisis on it as its value is balanced universally. cryptocurrencies are better options in financial uncertainty for the regions with unstable economical structures, which is becoming a major market driving factor for the market.",1
"bitcoin is one of the most popular and majorly adopted digital cash across the world. the rising visibility, growing interest of investors, and supporting regulations are further augmenting the market's growth. maturing bitcoin cash value and the facility to offer rewards for transactions are also upsurging digital cash’s market value. developing countries like japan, the u.s., european countries, and many more indicate people's inclination towards digital currency, which is expected to facilitate the cryptocurrency market growth in upcoming years.",1
"as virtual currencies are an unauthorized, decentralized, and uncontrollable exchanging platform, many regulators are worried about the increasing misuse of these currencies by criminals for illegal activities. it has been seen that many unlawful activities like tax evasion, money laundering, and terrorist financing have been carried out by criminals using digital money. in july 2019, treasury secretary steven mnuchin shared their concerns about the misuse of facebook, inc.'s patented libra digital currency by terrorist financiers and money launderers.  moreover, growing security concerns and cyber-attacks have led to the loss of the invested currencies, limiting the adoption of cryptocurrencies. for instance, in february 2020, digital currency exchange platforms of okex.com and bitfinex companies were disrupted with denial of service attacks. such security concerns and misuse of digital currencies become a major restraining factor for the industry’s growth.",1
"criminals and terrorists are more inclined to deal in cash and keep cash as collateral than to use financial intermediaries such as banks and avoid anti-money laundering reporting and compliance regulations. businesses and governments became worried that the pseudonymous and decentralized nature of digital currency transfers might offer a way for criminals to conceal their financial activities from the authorities. for instance, bitcoin was used on the web-based, illegal drug market called silk road. this exchange and bitcoin escrow program allowed more than 100,000 illegal product transactions from about january 2011 until october 2013, when the government shut down the company and detained persons operating the platform.",1
"the hardware segment is further classified based on platform types as graphical processing unit (gpu), field programmable gate array (fpga), application specific integrated circuit (asic), and others. the hardware segment comprises hardware implemented for crypto mining and exchange such as bitmain antminer s9i, halong mining dragonmint t1, pangolin whatsminer m3x, avalon6, among others. asic mining hardware is expected to hold the largest share mainly due to its high performance and high hash rate while mining a specific coin.",1
"the software segment is further categorized into mining software, exchange software, payment, wallet, and others. examples of crypto software include bemine, ecos, shamining, ccg mining, etc. exchange software uses a trading engine that is a single interface for connecting offers and exchanges with digital currency derivatives. the platform is used to match, sell and buy from users, thereby holding the largest share in the market. significant dispersion of exchange platforms is likely to drive the market globally. whereas, wallets can be hardware or software wallets. software wallets or digital wallets are seen to be adopted majorly due to their security enhancement. depending on the user's control over the private key protection function, digital wallets are categorized again as a self-hosted or custodial wallet.",1
"among these, bitcoin is a highly adopted digital currency in the market. according to a report published by deutsche bank ag in 2017, bitcoin is one of the most used digital currencies, and it will maintain its dominance over the coming years. ether, a virtual currency that can be used for accounting, investing, and establishing smart contracts and decentralized applications, is another popular virtual currency on the market. in the market, ether is projected to expand at a modest rate.",1
"similarly, ripple is used to verify debentures. the network established with ripple generates creditor-debtor relations and account balances accessible for each user within the network. the technical implementation of litecoin is the same as bitcoin, while it has the advantage that it is four times faster than bitcoin, which is projected to lead the market in upcoming years. other cryptocurrencies such as dogecoin, moneor, and dash also make a considerable contribution to market growth.",1
"trading captured the largest market share. the segment focuses on crypto solutions that are used for trading, such as pionex, cryptohopper, bitsgap, coinrule, and others. e-commerce and retail companies have started accepting cryptocurrencies as a payment option. for instance, in september 2019, the german branch of chain burger king restaurant accepted bitcoin as payment for its online deliveries and orders.",1
the penetration of virtual currencies in digital payment is expected to affect cross-border remittances. the financial institution is directing towards blockchain technology which is expected to drive the market in upcoming years.,1
"geographically, the market is segmented across five major regions, namely, north america, europe, asia pacific, the middle east & africa, and latin america.",1
"north america captured the largest share in the global market in 2020, as most of the region treated bitcoins as a medium of exchange for tax purposes rather than currency. although the government does not legally regulate the fact, many developed countries still focus on using digital money. acceptance of digital cash by consumers as well as retailers drives the growth of the market. additionally, the popularity of bitcoin mining and the presence of a majority of key players dominate the market in north america.",1
"besides, several technological developments and acceptance of virtual currency for some platforms in japan and taiwan are expected to majorly boom the market in the asia pacific. strategic collaborations, partnerships by key players also contribute to the market in the asia pacific. for instance, in january 2020, z corporation, inc. and taotao, inc. announced a collaboration with the financial service agency to expand the crypto market by confirming regulatory compliance in the japanese market. japan recently had accepted a new digital currency exchange during the covid-19 outbreak. similarly, malaysia’s securities commission legally has authorized digital currency exchange operators to operate in the country despite the national lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. it can be expected that the effect of the covid-19 outbreak may offer some opportunities for this market to grow in certain economies.",1
"the uae and dubai are at the forefront of blockchain development in the middle east, while bahrain and saudi arabia have recently taken measures towards the acceptance of digital cash.  the uae is introducing open ledger solutions. at the end of 2017, the central bank of the uae declared that it would collaborate with its counterpart in saudi arabia, the saudi arabian monetary authority (sama), to create a digital currency that could be used by both institutions and some commercial banks for fast and secure settlements. financial services firms in the region are among those who may profit greatly from the introduction of blockchain technologies in fields such as payments, supply chain, finance, and trading, as well as monitoring, compliance, and operations.",1
"companies operating in the market such as bitmain technologies ltd., xilinx, inc., intel corporation, advanced micro devices, inc., ripple labs, inc., bitfury group limited., ledger sas, nvidia corporation, bitgo, xapo, among others are focused on developing and offering different types of mining hardware and software solutions. also, the high competition in the market is forcing companies to focus on different strategic initiatives to strengthen their market positions.",1
"this market report provides an in-depth analysis of the market. it focuses on key aspects such as leading companies, product industry, and leading mining software and hardware solutions. besides this, the report offers insights into the cryptocurrency market trends and highlights key industry developments. in addition to the aforementioned factors, the report encompasses several key factors contributing to the market's growth over recent years.",1

"washington - the department of justice today announced that it has seized 63.7 bitcoins currently valued at approximately $2.3 million. these funds allegedly represent the proceeds of a may 8, ransom payment to individuals in a group known as darkside, which had targeted colonial pipeline, resulting in critical infrastructure being taken out of operation. the seizure warrant was authorized earlier today by the honorable laurel beeler, u.s. magistrate judge for the northern district of california.",1
"“following the money remains one of the most basic, yet powerful tools we have,” said deputy attorney general lisa o. monaco for the u.s. department of justice. “ransom payments are the fuel that propels the digital extortion engine, and today’s announcement demonstrates that the united states will use all available tools to make these attacks more costly and less profitable for criminal enterprises. we will continue to target the entire ransomware ecosystem to disrupt and deter these attacks. today’s announcements also demonstrate the value of early notification to law enforcement; we thank colonial pipeline for quickly notifying the fbi when they learned that they were targeted by darkside.”",0
"“there is no place beyond the reach of the fbi to conceal illicit funds that will prevent us from imposing risk and consequences upon malicious cyber actors,” said fbi deputy director paul abbate. “we will continue to use all of our available resources and leverage our domestic and international partnerships to disrupt ransomware attacks and protect our private sector partners and the american public.”",0
"on or about may 7, colonial pipeline was the victim of a highly publicized ransomware attack resulting in the company taking portions of its infrastructure out of operation. colonial pipeline reported to the fbi that its computer network was accessed by an organization named darkside and that it had received and paid a ransom demand for approximately 75 bitcoins.",1
"as alleged in the supporting affidavit, by reviewing the bitcoin public ledger, law enforcement was able to track multiple transfers of bitcoin and identify that approximately 63.7 bitcoins, representing the proceeds of the victim’s ransom payment, had been transferred to a specific address, for which the fbi has the “private key,” or the rough equivalent of a password needed to access assets accessible from the specific bitcoin address. this bitcoin represents proceeds traceable to a computer intrusion and property involved in money laundering and may be seized pursuant to criminal and civil forfeiture statutes.",1
"the special prosecutions section and asset forfeiture unit of the u.s. attorney’s office for the northern district of california is handling the seizure, with significant assistance from the department of justice criminal division’s money laundering and asset recovery section and computer crime and intellectual property section, and the national security division’s counterintelligence and export control section. the department components who worked on this seizure coordinated their efforts through the department’s ransomware and digital extortion task force, which was created to combat the growing number of ransomware and digital extortion attacks.",0
"the task force prioritizes the disruption, investigation, and prosecution of ransomware and digital extortion activity by tracking and dismantling the development and deployment of malware, identifying the cybercriminals responsible, and holding those individuals accountable for their crimes. the task force also strategically targets the ransomware criminal ecosystem as a whole and collaborates with domestic and foreign government agencies as well as private sector partners to combat this significant criminal threat.",0
cryptocurrency may be a good investment if you are willing to accept it is a high risk gamble which could pay off – but also that there is a strong chance you could lose all of your money.,1
"prices of cryptocurrencies including bitcoin have surged spectacularly in the past but they have plunged in 2022, so it is important that if you are planning to invest in them, you go in with your eyes open.",1
"before you buy and sell digital currency, know the risks so you can judge if investing in it is a good idea for you and your personal finances. here, we help you understand how cryptocurrency works.",1
the bank of england would not agree that it is a good investment. governor andrew bailey warned that people who invest should be prepared to lose all of their savings.,1
"when an investment makes headlines for soaraway returns, is featured in advertisements or endorsed by celebrities as a way to get rich, investors can pile in without thinking through the possible consequences.",1
"in the uk, people holding money with firms regulated by the financial conduct authority (fca) are protected by the financial services compensation scheme; if, say, a bank or building society goes bust, compensation of up to £85,000 will be available to customers through the fscs.",1
"most crypto assets, however, are not regulated by the fca, and so if the cryptocurrency exchange or platform where you have invested goes bust, there is no guarantee you will get your money back.",1
"“some firms are offering investments in crypto assets that promise high returns. if consumers decide to invest, they should be prepared to lose all their money.”",1
"early investors in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin will probably have made money. if you had spent £310 to buy one bitcoin in april 2016, six years later your investment would have been worth about £24,000.",1
"bitcoin’s price soared through 2021, reaching record highs of $69,000 in november. but the price of bitcoin has been falling in 2022 amid a wider cryptocurrency sell-off as investors steer clear or riskier investments at a time of rising inflation and interest rates.",1
"the price of a single bitcoin fell below $20,000 (£17,250) in june 2022 and has been loitering around that level since then (as of early september 2022).",1
"while that £17,250 value for one bitcoin is way more than its price of £310 in april 2016, the price fluctuations for even the most popular cryptocurrency highlight the extreme volatility of crypto investment.",1
"some new cryptocurrencies are intended to replace traditional currencies such as pounds or dollars. others are used to create new types of financial application, or swap value between various digital currencies.",1
"are you buying a totally worthless digital coin or something that offers innovative solutions to existing financial problems? if you are new to digital assets, read our article on cryptocurrency trading for beginners.",1
"in 2013, one bitcoin was worth just under $112, and the currency had a total market value – all the bitcoins in circulation multiplied by the price of each one – of just over $1.2bn.",1
"devcoin, novacoin and chncoin are no longer listed by the price-tracking website coinmarketcap, while freicoin and terracoin have fallen in value and the latter is worth a fraction what it was in 2013.",1
so while the standard advice for investors in any asset is to keep their money where it is for at least five years to ride out market downturns and benefit from the good times – as some bitcoin investors have done – buying smaller coins and holding onto them as a long-term investment.,1
there is a constant stream of new cryptocurrencies entering the market. dogecoin is just one recent example: it took off in may 2021 but has struggled to sustain investor momentum.,1
"launched in 2015, it had been on a steep upwards trajectory since july 2021, reaching a record high of $4,617. in late january 2022, its price had fallen to $2,411, and as of early september its value was about $1,570.",1
bear in mind however that almost two years ago it was around $122. it is still one of the most popular cryptocurrencies largely because it has more uses beyond just being a cryptocurrency.,1
"ethereum is used in smart contracts on the blockchain networks crucial to cryptocurrencies, and payments company visa recently said it would use it to record crypto payments.",1
"when you look at the history of bitcoin, it reached the £10,000 mark after about four years, so ethereum could follow a similar trajectory given its popularity.",1
"an important point to bear in mind about investing is that you only lose money if you sell when the asset falls below the price you paid for it, as you end up crystallising your losses. read more in our beginner’s guide to investing.",1
"more of them are investing in cryptocurrency than ever before, and investment banking giant jp morgan chase advised in february 2021 that investors could consider putting 1% of their investments into bitcoin as a way to diversify their portfolio.",1
"some early investors who have persisted have evidently made themselves rich. those who haven’t? well, it should be fairly clear that the value of their investments has fallen to next to nothing.",1
bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency and commands a high long-term value because it has never been hacked and has maintained 100% uptime since it was launched.,1
"when inflation rises, as it is doing at the moment, the value of your cash falls. as the years pass, we can buy fewer goods and services with the money in our bank accounts.",1
"the first of these potential advantages could also be applied to the stock markets – and, history suggests, to crypto assets such as bitcoin. that’s why so much long-term investment advice is focused on moving cash out of our bank accounts and into stocks and shares that could appreciate over time.",1
"baked into the bitcoin code is the promise that no more than 21 million units of bitcoin will ever be created. so instead of being an inflationary currency like sterling or dollars, some experts argue bitcoin is the opposite: it is deflationary, increasing in value with the passing of time.",1
"a cryptocurrency operates as a medium of exchange that runs on cryptographic algorithms to secure transactions and limit the creation of units of the currency. cryptocurrencies, also known as cryptos, use decentralized control, which contradicts the central bank systems and centralized digital currency. they also belong to a subset of alternative currencies known as altcoins or digital currencies.",1
"the decentralized control of every cryptocurrency functions excellently via distributed ledger technology (dlt). usually, most cryptos work through a blockchain that acts as a public financial transaction database.",1
"decentralized cryptocurrencies are produced by the whole cryptosystem collectively. the production rate is defined when the system is developed, and it is publicly known. in the centralized economic and banking systems like the federal reserve system, governments or corporate boards control currency supply through printing fiat money units or demanding additions to the digital banking ledgers.",1
"for the cryptocurrencies, no company or government can produce new units. the underlying technical system upon which cryptos are based was initially created by the mysterious satoshi nakamoto, bitcoin’s creator.",1
"bitcoin became the flagship decentralized cryptocurrency in 2009. with its formation, the digital currencies made a giant leap from academic phenomenon to reality. since then, more than 6,000 altcoins (alternative variants of bitcoin) have been created. the most popular altcoins currently include ripple, ethereum, bitcoin cash, ethereum classic, chainlink, bitcoin sv, dash, litecoin, and tron.",1
a cryptocurrency’s key feature is that it cannot be governed by any centralized authority. the decentralized nature of the underlying blockchain technology makes cryptocurrency immune to the traditional regulations and intrusions of legacy systems.,1
"while the cryptocurrency sector is still nascent and expanding, the market is historically volatile. thus, it is quite risky to invest money in it without a thorough analysis of the trends and market determinants.",1

"a cryptocurrency can be easily defined as a digital currency. however, the concept behind the value and security of cryptocurrency is quite abstract and esoteric. some people are confused about what makes cryptocurrency valuable and what makes it efficient as a means of storing and transferring value. cryptocurrencies are also sometimes known as “altcoins” – short for alternative coins.",1
"there was once a time when the world operated with the barter system. someone looking to sell or trade their goods would need to find another person willing to take those goods in trade for the exact other goods they were looking for. this is called the double coincidence of wants. for example, imagine a farmer who wants to trade his bushels of wheat for clothing. he would need to find a tailor who is also looking for wheat to be able to trade. fiat money solved this issue by creating a store of value. but at the time of its inception and creation, people used to the barter system were probably wondering why worthless paper would be equally or more valuable than their goods.",1
"cryptocurrency does to fiat money what fiat money did to the barter system. it creates an alternative store of value that lets users not only pay for goods but also pay for other currencies. if cryptocurrency is liquid to other fiat currencies, then these fiat currencies are liquid to each other. however, some people may be confused as to why cryptocurrency holds value, similarly to how barterers may have wondered why paper money holds value.",1
"at the root of it all, any type of currency is valuable because it is accepted as a store of value. the more people accept this, the more valuable the money becomes. additionally, more acceptance leads to more stability in the value of the money. additionally, both fiat money and cryptocurrencies solve the issue of the double coincidence of wants.",1
"furthermore, cryptocurrency runs on blockchain technology. this new and ingenious technological concept increases the security of the currency and allows for the verification of transactions in the currency.",1
"finally, cryptocurrency is infinitely divisible. whereas the smallest amount in us dollars one can receive is a cent – or $0.01 – you can receive 0.00000000000001 bitcoin if need be.",1
"the blockchain network is supported by voluntary “miners”. miners are computer systems that are offered for use in the specific networks that support each cryptocurrency. for example, the bitcoin blockchain network is supported by thousands of individual computers that help “mine” the network.",1
"“mining” is the act of verifying, encrypting, and securing transactions in each block. each miner (computer system) has a ledger of all past and current transactions operating in the network. this means that every new transaction can be recorded and verified in the ledger. if someone tries to create any counterfeit coins or steal coins from another person’s cryptocurrency wallet, this is checked against the millions of copies of the ledger. all legitimate copies of the ledger will return an invalid authentication on the fraudulent transaction, and as such, the counterfeit or stolen coins will not be recorded.",1
"miners are rewarded for participating in transaction verification with a small portion of coins. for example, the typical mining fee for a transaction of ethereum may be 0.000444 eth. this fee is split amongst all the miners who participated in the verification and authentication.",1
"cryptocurrency wallets can either be software (apps) or hardware (thumb drive or card) wallets. these wallets act as smaller versions of “miners” in the sense that they record and verify transactions. they store the value of your coins and let you know how many coins you have in total. when you deposit bitcoin into your wallet, for example, the wallet verifies that transaction against the mining networks ledgers to let the network know that the coins are now in your possession inside the wallet.",1
"each wallet, both software and hardware, has addresses that resemble hash codes. this is a long string of letters and numbers. when you deposit coins into your wallet, you use this address to let the network know where to send the coins, and where it will be stored in the meantime.",1
