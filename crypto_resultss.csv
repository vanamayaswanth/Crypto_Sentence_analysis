38032,367195,yeah make sense ie volatility typically cause volume thatd relegated dexs since frequent price difference would mean arbitrage oppurtunities im curious would ratio volume btw cex amd dex ever change significantly,1
38033,367196,idk feel passive aggressive ton data source dex cex trade correlationcausality study dont know youre bringing trading bot sandwich attack,1
38034,367197,yes exactly higher vol cause arb opportunity dexs also cexs given prevalent passive lping many dexs lead trading volume one would expect effect become pronounced tvl there passive lp dexs arb opportunity get bigger arbitrageur trade bigger size agains pool theyre back line paradoxically one could argue higher tvl passive lp dexs actually make price discovery somewhat slower le efficient need move capital get new pricing info reflected pool balance implied spot price guess there somewhere sweet spot though want meaningful tvl passive lp dexs able absorb normal trade size much tvl could actually become detrimental efficient price discovery need lot trading volume keep market line,1

38041,367206,see mean price discovery slower would market wait trade large tvl amm finish executing seems like market would want price discovery happen speed fastest element,1
38042,367207,,0
38043,367208,yeah maybe word slower wasnt ideal meant tend need trading volume dex incorporate new market info compared cex regularly updating orderbook also without trade happening,1
38044,367209,,0
38045,367210,hmmmmm mean token traded amms yes there really equivalent l2 data amm world yeah youd incorporate data stream god know source long take maybe already exists speed price discovery would time incorporate l2 like data amms time order execute token also traded order book exchange consensus order book price discovery happens amms exist quick liquidity speed price discovery rate happens order book could argue amms aid price discovery would love see reseaech conduct one isnt literature yet even id guess speed price discovery speed fastest amm trade bit slower order book moment though,1
38046,367211,adding slowness large tvl amms game theory conclusion example pretend 1 order book exchange price discovery happens 2 amms 1 significantly larger tvl would market overall incentive allow arbitrage happen low tvl amms therefore pricing larger arbitrage opourtunities larger tvl amm perhaps easy comparing multiple frequency arbitrage opputunities happen potential profit per arbitrage,1
38047,367212,think amms dont really contribute price discovery thats little bit point trying make earlier amm passive lp waiting arbitrageur come adapt amm isnt really taking active role price discovery arbitrageur who pushing amm line thereby establish price discovery relates back question might reason increasing trading volume dexs compared cexs think one reason dex amms passive need arbitrageur adjust new price entail trading volume order kind update dexs amm state amount trading volume needed higher passive lp tvl,1
38048,367213,ahaha see point assuming amms adjust price market arbitrage conclusion 1 amm volume course driven volume order book 2 ratio amm volume dex would increase higher volume environment since right much le volume amms approx equal increase absolute volume much higher percentage increase total trading volume amms,1
38049,367214,yeah whats interesting also think staleness large tvl pool could potentially find interpreted market signal ie lp remain passive accident laziness choice staleness pool get whole different meaning one might consider deviation compared cex wrong sense cex dex,1
38050,367215,going back dashboard shared arent noticeable bump volume thats attributed amms thatd suggest amms still havent found use case would drive significantly larger volume exchange prevalent use case ive seen dapps part amm ecosystem liquidity guy dont need super high volume trade,1
38051,367216,hypothesis would passive tvl dex pool higher vol given asset pair trading volume one might expect see capital kind energy needed flow update dex compared cex market,1
38052,367217,reading amm paper megabrain team chitraevansangeris last year ive come opposite conclusion amms simply passive amms hold latent potential space arb part necessary ecosystem moreover symbiotic relationship two organism yet fully understood explored price discovery obvious first order effect relationship hint something far complex coming future perhaps amms appear passive today theyre awaiting innovation unlock,1
38053,367218,yeah totally agree referring currently prevalent cfmms excluding univ3 afaik bigger one moment requiring active lping require arbitrageur eliminate price discrepancy yeah open amm term also include type amms also havent even discovered yet guess youre right,1
38054,367219,hmmm wouldnt worry even claim say cex dex people different view pricing would reason there incentive trade across two case there much execution risk dexs,1
38055,367220,yeah agree although depends way lp behave dex example dex lp always passive dex price always long wasnt arbitrageur move back line,1
38056,367221,paper detail complexity would see 2 possible way amms could add complexity 1 investor execution trader look pricing across venue amms order book otc desk batch auction exchange etc would certainly impact price discovery happens setting expectation right current pricing amms indirect way contributing price discovery 2 amms used bootstrap liquidity conducting large private transaction la like fashion sizable private investment fashion think already happening degree also link paper,1

38058,367223,actually guess 3rd innovationcomplexity first version already implemented uniswap v3 allowing stakers choose price range would like yield think staking position equivalent l2 data order book someone would rather stake take position market would stakers group incentive discover price efficient way left answered amms figure catch 2 bird price discovery easy liquidity thatd breakdown current paradigm easy liquidity v price discovery,1
